<h2 class="nobreak" id="The_Cost_of_Modern">The Cost of Modern
Sentiment</h2>
</div>


<p>We are rising dizzily and fearlessly
on the crest of a great
wave of sentiment. When the
wave breaks, we may find ourselves submerged,
and in danger of drowning; but
for the present we are full of hope and
high resolve. Forty years ago we stood
in shallow water, and mocked at the mid-Victorian
sentiment, then ebbing slowly
with the tide. We have nothing now in
common with that fine, thin, tenacious
conception of life and its responsibilities.
We do not prate about valour for
men, and domesticity for women. A
vague humanity is our theme. We do not
feel the fastidious distaste for repulsive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
details which made our grandparents
culpably negligent. All knowledge, apart
from its quality, and apart from our requirements,
now seems to us desirable.
Taste is no longer a controlling force.
We do not, if we can help it, look “that
jade, Duty,”—I use Sir Walter Scott’s
phrase, and he knew the lady in question
better than do most men,—squarely in
the face; but we speak well of her behind
her back, which is more than Sir
Walter did. To hear us talk, one would
imagine that she never cost a pang.</p>

<p>The sentiment of to-day is social and
philanthropic. It has no affiliations with
art, which stands aloof from it,—a new
experience for the world. It dominates
periodical literature, minor fiction, and
serious verse; but it has so far given
nothing of permanent value to letters. It
is in high favour with politicians, and is
echoed loudly from all party platforms.
It has unduly influenced our attitude toward
the war in Europe, and toward our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
defences at home. It is a force to be reckoned
with, and to be controlled. It is
capable of raising us to a better and
clearer vision, or of weakening our judgment
and shattering our common sense.
If we value our safety, we must forever
bear in mind that sentiment is subjective,
and a personal thing. However exalted
and however ardent, it cannot be
accepted as a scale for justice, or as a
test for truth.</p>

<p>The issues with which our modern
sentiment chiefly concerns itself are the
conditions of labour, the progress of women,
the social evil, and—for the past
two years—the overwhelming question
of peace and war. Sometimes these issues
are commingled. Always they have a
bearing upon one another. There is also
a distinct and perilous tendency toward
sentiment in matters political and judicial;
while an excess of emotionalism is
the stumbling-block of those noble associations
which work for the protection of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
animals. It is profoundly discouraging
to read in the accredited organ of an
American humane society an angry protest
against Vilhjalmur Stefansson’s being
permitted the use of Eskimo dogs on
his Arctic explorations, because, forsooth,
when he went hungry, the dogs went
hungry too, and because their feet were
hurt by the ice. The writer (a woman)
reminds us that these dogs (like all other
animals) are not “free agents”; and she
calls upon public opinion and law to rescue
them. We hear about the “long arm
of the law,” but it would be a giant stretch
that could reach Stefansson in his ice-fields.
“Men who do such things,” she
affirms, “are not heroes of the highest
type; and, anyway, when you have found
or explored the North Pole or the South
Pole, what can you do with it?”</p>

<p>This query is hard to answer. Perhaps
no explorer wants to do anything with
the Poles; but just leave them as they
are, uncolonized for the present. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
are not the only things in the world which
have no commercial value. But if Stefansson
is not a hero, of what stuff are
heroes made, and where shall we look to
find one? And with all Europe crying
out in its agony of pain, is it worth our
while to worry over a few dogs, who are
doing, under hard conditions, the work
they are fitted to do?</p>

<p>The same journal insults the intelligence
of its readers by printing a wild
rhapsody of Mrs. Annie Besant’s, apparently
under the illusion that it can be accepted
as an argument for vegetarianism.
I venture to quote one particularly mad
paragraph as an illustration of the unplumbed
depths to which emotional humanitarianism
can descend:—</p>

<p>“The killing of animals in order to
devour their flesh is so obviously an outrage
on all humane feelings, that one is
almost ashamed to mention it in a paper
that is regarding man as a director of
evolution. If any one who eats flesh could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
be taken to the shambles, to watch the
agonized struggles of the terrified victims
as they are dragged to the spot where
knife or mallet slays them; if he could
be made to stand with the odours of the
blood reeking in his nostrils; if there his
astral vision could be opened so that he
might see the filthy creatures that flock
round to feast on the loathsome exhalations,
and see also the fear and horror of
the slaughtered beasts as they arrive in
the astral world, and send back thence
currents of dread and hatred that flow between
men and animals in constantly re-fed
streams; if a man could pass through
these experiences, he would be cured of
meat-eating forever.”</p>

<p>Now, when one has belonged for many
years to the society which printed this
precious paragraph, when one has believed
all one’s life that to be sentient is
to possess rights, and that, not kindness
only, but justice to the brute creation is
an essential element of decent living, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
is hard to be confronted with unutterable
nonsense about astral currents and astral
visions. It is harder still to be held indirectly
responsible for the publication of
such nonsense, and to entertain for the
thousandth time the weary conviction
that common sense is not a determining
factor in humanity.</p>

<p>Mr. Chesterton, upon whom the delight
of startling his readers never seems
to pall, has declared that men are more
sentimental than women, “whose only
fault is their excessive sense.” Also that
the apparent absorption of the modern
world in social service is not the comprehensive
thing it seems. The general public
still remains indifferent. This may or
may not be true. It is as hard for Mr.
Chesterton as for the rest of us to know
much about that remnant of the public
which is not writing, or lecturing, or collecting
data, or collecting funds, or working
for clubs and societies. But no one
can say that the social reformer is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
slighted creature that he was a half-century
ago. He meets with the most distinguished
consideration, and he is always
accorded the first hearing in print
and on the platform. He commands our
respect when he deals soberly with sober
facts in sober language, when his conclusions
are just, his statements irrefutable.
He is less praiseworthy when he flies to
fiction, an agreeable but unconvincing
medium; or to verse, which, as the theologian
said of “Paradise Lost,” “proves
nothing.” It is very good verse sometimes,
and its grace of sentiment, its note
of appeal, find an easy echo in the reader’s
heart.</p>

<p>A little poem called “The Factories,”
published in “McClure’s Magazine” for
September, 1912, gives an almost perfect
example of the modern point of view, of
the emotional treatment of an economic
question, and of the mental confusion
which arises from the substitution of
sympathy for exactness.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Feet that pace beside the loom, hands that cannot rest:</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">How can she know motherhood, whose strength is gone?</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Round my path they cry to me, little souls unborn,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">God of Life—Creator! It was I! It was I.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Now if by “I” is meant the average
woman who wears the “robe,” the “ribbon,”
the “feather,” and possibly—though
rarely—the “wreath across my
hair,” “I” must protest distinctly against
assuming a guilt which is none of mine.
I have not shut my little sister in a factory,
any more than I have ranged the
meadow-lands, “free from sun to sun.”
What I probably am doing is trying to
persuade my sister to cook my dinner,
and sweep my house, and help me to
take care of my “gold-heads,” who are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
not always so sleepy as I could desire.
If my sister declines to do this at a wage
equal to her factory earnings, and with
board and lodging included, she is well
within her rights, and I have no business,
as is sometimes my habit, weakly to
complain of her decision. If I made my
household arrangements acceptable to
her, she would come. As this is difficult
or distasteful to me, she goes to a factory
instead. The right of every man
and woman to do the work he or she
chooses to do, and can do, at what
wages, and under what conditions he or
she can command, is the fruit of centuries
of struggle. It is now so well established
that only the trade unions venture
to deny it.</p>

<p>In that vivid and sad study of New
York factory life, published some years
ago by the Century Company, under the
title of “The Long Day,” a girl who is
out of work, and who has lost her few
possessions in a lodging-house fire, seeks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
counsel of a wealthy stranger who has
befriended her.</p>

<p>“The lady looked at me a moment
out of fine, clear eyes.</p>

<p>“‘You would not go into service, I
suppose?’ she asked slowly.</p>

<p>“I had never thought of such an alternative
before, but I met it without a
moment’s hesitation. ‘No, I would not
care to go into service,’ I replied; and,
as I did so, the lady’s face showed mingled
disappointment and disgust.</p>

<p>“‘That is too bad,’ she answered, ‘for,
in that case, I’m afraid I can do nothing
for you.’ And she went out of the room,
leaving me, I must confess, not sorry
for having thus bluntly decided against
wearing the definite badge of servitude.”</p>

<p>Here at least is a refreshingly plain
statement of facts. The girl in question
bore the servitude imposed upon her by
the foremen of half a dozen factories;
she slept for many months in quarters
which no domestic servant would consent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
to occupy; she ate food which no
servant would be asked to eat; she associated
with young women whom no
servant would accept as equals and companions.
But, as she had voluntarily relinquished
comfort, protection, and the
grace of human relations between employer
and employed, she accepted her
chosen conditions, and tried successfully
to better them along her chosen lines.
The reader is made to understand that
it was as unreasonable for the benevolent
lady—who had visions of a trim and
white-capped parlor-maid dancing before
her eyes—to show “disappointment
and disgust” because her overtures were
rejected, as it would have been to charge
the same lady with robbing the girl of
her “day of maidenhood,” and her “little
souls unborn,” by shutting her up in
a factory. If we will blow our minds clear
of generous illusions, we shall understand
that an emotional verdict has no validity
when offered as a criterion of facts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>The excess of sentiment, which is misleading
in philanthropy and economics,
grows acutely dangerous when it interferes
with legislation, or with the ordinary
rulings of morality. The substitution
of a sentimental principle of authority for
the impersonal processes of law confuses
our understanding, and undermines our
sense of justice. It is a painful truth that
most laws have had their origin in a profound
mistrust of human nature (even
Mr. Olney admits that the Constitution,
although framed in the interests of freedom,
is not strictly altruistic); but the
time is hardly ripe for brushing aside
this ungenerous mistrust, and establishing
the social order on a basis of pure
enthusiasm. The reformers who light-heartedly
announce that people are
“tired of the old Constitution anyway,”
voice the buoyant creed of ignorance.
I once heard a popular lecturer say of a
popular idol that he “preferred making
precedents to following them,” and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
remark evoked a storm of applause. It
was plain that the audience considered
following a precedent to be a timorous
and unworthy thing for a strong man to
do; and it was equally plain that nobody
had given the matter the benefit of a
serious thought. Believers in political
faith-healing enjoy a supreme immunity
from doubt.</p>

<p>This growing contempt for paltry but
not unuseful restrictions, this excess of
sentiment, combined with paucity of
humour and a melodramatic attitude toward
crime, has had some discouraging
results. It is ill putting the strong man,
or the avenging angel, or the sinned-against
woman above the law, which is
a sacred trust for the preservation of life
and liberty. It is ill so to soften our hearts
with a psychological interest in the lawbreaker
that no criminal is safe from
popularity. The “Nation” performed a
well-timed duty when it commented
grimly on the message sent to the public<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
by a murderer, and a singularly cold-blooded
murderer, through the minister
who attended him on the scaffold: “Mr.
Beattie desired to thank his many friends
for kind letters and expressions of interest,
and the public for whatever sympathy
was felt or expressed.”</p>

<p>It sounds like a cabinet minister who
has lost an honoured and beloved wife;
not like an assassin who has lured <i>his</i>
wife to a lonely spot, and there pitilessly
killed her. One fails to see why “kind
letters” and “expressions of interest”
should have poured in upon this malefactor,
just as one fails to see why a young
woman who shot her lover a few months
later in Columbus, Ohio, should have received
an ovation in the court-room. It
was not even her first lover (it seldom
is); but when a gallant jury had acquitted
her of all blame in the trifling matter
of manslaughter, “the crowd shouted its
approval”; “scores of women rushed up
to her, and insisted upon kissing her”;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
and an intrepid suitor, stimulated by circumstances
which might have daunted
a less mettlesome man, announced his
intention of marrying the heroine on the
spot.</p>

<p>In New York a woman murdered her
lover because he refused his aid—a
dastardly refusal—when her husband
had cast her off. She was not only acquitted
by a jury,—which was to be expected;
but the husband, pleased with
the turn affairs had taken, restored her
to his home and his affections; and a
sympathetic newspaper offered this explanation
to a highly gratified public:
“They are Sicilians, and in Sicily a woman
may retrieve her own honour and
avenge her husband’s, only by doing as
this woman had done.”</p>

<p>Perhaps. But New York is not Sicily,
our civilization is not Sicilian civilization,
and our courts of law are not modelled
on a Sicilian vendetta. The reporter described
with all the eloquence of his craft<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
the young wife reconciled and joyous in
her husband’s arms, laughing and singing
to her baby, happier than she had
been at any time since her honeymoon.
A pretty picture, if the shadow of a murdered
man did not intrude upon it.</p>

<p>Our revolt from the old callous cruelty—the
heart-sickening cruelty of the eighteenth
century—has made us tender to
criminals, and strangely lenient to their
derelictions. It inspires genial visitors at
Sing Sing to write about the “fine type”
of men, sentenced for the foulest of crimes.
It fills us all with concern lest detention
prove irksome to the detained, lest baseball
and well-appointed vaudeville should
not sufficiently beguile the tedium of
their leisure hours.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Sentiment has been defined as a revolt
from the despotism of facts. It is often a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
revolt from authority, which, to the sentimentalist,
seems forever despotic; and
this revolt, or rather this easy disregard
of authority, is fatal to the noblest efforts of
the humanitarian. The women of wealth
and position who from time to time fling
themselves with ardour into the cause of
striking shirt-waist-makers and garment-makers
are always well intentioned, but
not always well advised. In so far as they
uphold the strikers in what are often just
and reasonable demands, they do good
work; and the substantial aid they give
is sweetened by the spirit in which it is
given,—the sense of fellow feeling with
their kind. But there is no doubt that one
of the lessons taught at such times to our
foreign-born population is that the laws
of our country may be disregarded with
impunity. The picketers who attack the
“scab” workers, and are arrested for
disorderly conduct, are swiftly released,
to become the heroines of the hour. I
once remonstrated with a friend who had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
given bail for a dozen of these young
lawbreakers, and she answered reproachfully:
“But they are so ignorant and
helpless. There were two poor bewildered
girls in court yesterday who did not know
enough English to understand the charge
made against them. You could not conceive
of anything more pathetic.”</p>

<p>I said that a young woman who bowled
over another young woman into the gutter
understood perfectly the charge made
against her, whether she spoke English
or not. One does not have to study French
or Spanish to know that one may not
knock down a Frenchman or a Spaniard.
No civilized country permits this robust
line of argument. But reason is powerless
when sentiment takes the helm. It
would be as easy to argue with a conflagration
as with unbalanced zeal. The
vision of a good cause debauched by intemperance
is familiar to all students of
sociology; but it is no less melancholy for
being both recognizable and ridiculous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>A moderate knowledge of history—which,
though discouraging, is also enlightening—might
prove serviceable to
all the enthusiasts who are engaged in
making over the world. Many of them
(in this country, at least) talk and write
as if nothing in particular had happened
between the Deluge and the Civil War.
That they sometimes know as little of
the Civil War as of the Deluge is proven
by the lament of an ardent and oratorical
pacifist that this great struggle should be
spoken of in school histories as a war for
the preservation of the Union, instead of
a war for the abolishment of slavery. A
lady lecturer, very prominent in social
work, has made the gratifying announcement
that “the greatest discovery of the
nineteenth century is woman’s discovery
of herself. It is only within the last fifty
years that it has come to be realized that
a woman is human, and has a right to
think and act for herself.”</p>

<p>Now, after all, the past cannot be a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
closed page, even to one so exclusively
concerned with the present. A little less
talking, a little more reading, and such
baseless generalizations would be impossible,
even on that stronghold of ignorance,
the platform. If women failed to
discover themselves a hundred, or five
hundred years ago, it was because they
had never been lost; it was because their
important activities left them no leisure
for self-contemplation. Yet Miss Jane
Addams, who has toiled so long and so
nobly for the bettering of social conditions,
and whose work lends weight to
her words, displays in “A New Conscience
and an Ancient Evil” the same
placid indifference to all that history has
to tell. What can we say or think when
confronted by such an astounding passage
as this?</p>

<p>“Formerly all that the best woman
possessed was a negative chastity, which
had been carefully guarded by her parents
and duennas. The chastity of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
modern woman of self-directed activity
and of a varied circle of interests, which
give her an acquaintance with many men
as well as women, has therefore a new
value and importance in the establishment
of social standards.”</p>

<p>“Negative chastity!” “Parents and
duennas!” Was there ever such a maiden
outlook upon life! It was the chastity of
the married woman upon which rested
the security of the civilized world;—that
chastity which all men prized, and
most men assailed, which was preserved
in the midst of temptations unknown in
our decorous age, and held inviolate by
women whose “acquaintance with many
men” was at least as intimate and potent
as anything experienced to-day.
Committees and congresses are not the
only meeting-grounds for the sexes.
“Remember,” says M. Taine, writing of
a time which was not so long ago that
it need be forgotten, “remember that
during all these years women were paramount.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
They set the social tone, led society,
and thereby guided public opinion.
When they appeared in the vanguard of
political progress, we may be sure that
the men were following.”</p>

<p>We might be sure of the same thing
to-day, were it not for the tendency of
the modern woman to sever her rights
and wrongs from the rights and wrongs
of men; thereby resembling the disputant
who, being content to receive half
the severed baby, was adjudged by the
wise Solomon to be unworthy of any
baby at all. Half a baby is every whit as
valuable as the half-measure of reform
which fails to take into impartial consideration
the inseparable claims of men
and women. Even in that most vital of
all reforms, the crusade against social
evils, the welfare of both sexes unifies the
subject. Here again we are swayed by
our anger at the indifference of an earlier
generation, at the hard and healthy attitude
of men like Huxley, who had not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
imagination enough to identify the possible
saint with the certain sinner, and who
habitually confined their labours to fields
which promised sure results. “In my
judgment,” wrote Huxley, “a domestic
servant, who is perhaps giving half her
wages to support her old parents, is more
worthy of help than half a dozen Magdalens.”</p>

<p>If we are forced to choose between
them,—yes. But our esteem for the servant’s
self-respecting life, with its decent
restraints and its purely normal activities,
need not necessarily harden our
hearts against the women whom Mr.
Huxley called “Magdalens,” nor against
those whom we luridly designate as
“white slaves.” No work under Heaven
is more imperative than the rescue of
young and innocent girls; no crime is
more dastardly than the sale of their
youth and innocence; no charity is
greater than that which lifts the sinner
from her sin. But the fact that we habitually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
apply the term “white slave” to
the wilful prostitute as well as to the entrapped
child shows that a powerful and
popular sentiment is absolved from the
shackles of accuracy. Also that this absolution
confuses the minds of men. The
sentimentalist pities the prostitute as a
victim; the sociologist abhors her as a
menace. The sentimentalist conceives
that men prey, and women are preyed
upon; the sociologist, aware that evil
men and women prey upon one another
ceaselessly and ravenously, has no measure
of mercy for sin. The sentimentalist
clings tenaciously to the association of
youth with innocence; the sociologist
knows that even the age-limit which the
law fixes as a boundary-line of innocence
has no corresponding restriction in fact.
It is inconceivable that so many books
and pamphlets dealing with this subject—books
and pamphlets now to be found
on every library shelf, and in the hands
of young and old—should dare to ignore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
the balance of depravity, the swaying of
the pendulum of vice.</p>

<p>A new and painful instance of the cost
of modern sentiment is afforded by the
statement of Miss Addams and other pacifists
that middle-aged men are in favour
of strengthened defences, and that
young men oppose them, as savouring of
militarism; that middle-aged men cling
to the belief that war may be just and
righteous, and that young men reject
it, as unreservedly and inevitably evil.
I am loath to accept this statement, as I
am loath to accept all unpleasant statements;
but if it be—as I presume it is—based
upon data, or upon careful observation,
it fits closely with my argument.
The men under thirty are the men who
have done their thinking in an era of undiluted
sentiment. The men over forty
were trained in a simpler, sterner creed.
The call to duty embraced for them the
call to arms.</p>

<p class="p0">Some of them remember the days when
Americans died for their country, and it
is a recollection good for the soul. Again,
the men over forty were taught by men;
the men under thirty were taught by
women; and the most dangerous economy
practised by our extravagant Republic
is the eliminating of the male
teacher from our public schools. It is no
insult to femininity to say that the feminization
of boys is not a desirable development.</p>

<p>It was thought and said a few years
ago that the substitution of organized
charities for the somewhat haphazard
benevolence of our youth would exclude
sentiment, just as it excluded human and
personal relations with the poor. It was
thought and said that the steady advance
of women in commercial and civic life
would correct the sentimental bias which
only Mr. Chesterton has failed to observe
in the sex. No one who reads books and
newspapers, or listens to speeches, or indulges<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
in the pleasures of conversation
can any longer cherish these illusions.
No one can fail to see that sentiment is
the motor power which drives us to intemperate
words and actions; which
weakens our judgment, and destroys
our sense of proportion. The current
phraseology, the current criticisms, the
current enthusiasms of the day, all betray
an excess of emotionalism. I pick up
a table of statistics, furnishing economic
data, and this is what I read: “Case 3.
Two children under five. Mother shortly
expecting the supreme trial of womanhood.”
That is the way to write stories,
and, possibly, sermons; but it is not the
way to write reports. I pick up a newspaper,
and learn that an Englishman
visiting the United States has made the
interesting announcement that he is a
reincarnation of one of the Pharaohs, and
that an attentive and credulous band of
disciples are gathering wisdom from his
lips. I pick up a very serious and very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
well-written book on the Brontë sisters,
and am told that if I would “touch the
very heart of the mystery that was
Charlotte Brontë” (I had never been
aware that there was anything mysterious
about this famous lady), I will find
it—save the mark!—in her passionate
love for children.</p>

<p>“We are face to face here, not with a
want, but with an abyss, depth beyond
depth of tenderness, and longing, and
frustration; with a passion that found no
clear voice in her works because it was
one with the elemental nature in her, undefined,
unuttered, unutterable!”</p>

<p>It was certainly unuttered. It was not
even hinted at in Miss Brontë’s novels,
nor in her voluminous correspondence.
Her attitude toward children—so far as
it found expression—was the arid but
pardonable attitude of one who had been
their reluctant caretaker and teacher. If,
as we are now told, “there were moments
when it was pain for Charlotte to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
see the children born of and possessed
by other women,” there were certainly
hours—so much she makes clear to us—in
which the business of looking after
them wearied her beyond her powers of
endurance. It is true that Miss Brontë
said a few, a very few friendly words
about these little people. She did not,
like Swift, propose that babies should
be cooked and eaten. But this temperate
regard, this restricted benevolence,
gives us no excuse for wallowing in
sentiment at her expense.</p>

<p>“If some virtues are new, all vices are
old.” We can reckon the cost of misdirected
emotions by the price which the
past has paid for them. We know the
full significance of that irresponsible
sympathy which grows hysterical over
animals it should soberly protect; which
accuses the consumer of strange cruelties
to the producer; which condones lawbreaking
and vindicates the lawbreaker;
which admits no difference between attack<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
and resistance, between a war of
aggression and a war of defence; which
confuses moral issues, ignores experience,
and insults the intelligence of mankind.</p>

<p>The reformer whose heart is in the
right place, but whose head is elsewhere,
represents a waste of force; and we cannot
afford any waste in the conservation
of honour and goodness. We cannot
afford errors of judgment, or errors of
taste. The business of leading lives morally
worthy of men is neither simple nor
easy. And there are moments when, with
the ageing Fontenelle, we sigh and say,
“I am beginning to see things as they
are. It is surely time for me to die.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Our_Loss_of_Nerve">Our Loss of Nerve</h2>
</div>


<p>If any lover of Hogarth will look at
the series of pictures which tell the
story of the Idle and the Industrious
Apprentice, he will feel that while the
industrious apprentice fitted admirably
into his time and place, the idle apprentice
had the misfortune to be born out of
date. In what a different spirit would his
tragic tale be told to-day, and what different
emotions it would awaken. A poor
tired boy, who ought to be at school or
at play, sleeping for very exhaustion at
his loom. A cruel boss daring to strike
the worn-out lad. No better playground
given him in the scant leisure which
Sunday brings than a loathsome grave-yard.
No healthier sport provided for
him than gaming. And, in the end, a
lack of living wage forcing him to steal.
Unhappy apprentice, to have lived and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
sinned nearly two centuries too soon!
And as if this were not a fate bitter
enough for tears, he must needs have
contrasted with him at every step an industrious
companion, whom that unenlightened
age permitted to work as hard
as he pleased, even for the benefit of a
master, and to build up his own fortunes
on the foundation of his own worth. Hogarth’s
simple conception of personal responsibility
and of personal equation is
as obsolete as the clumsy looms at which
his apprentices sit, and the full-skirted
coats they wear.</p>

<p>Yet the softening of the hard old rules,
the rigid old standards, has not tended
to strengthen the fibre of our race. Nobody
supposes that the industrious apprentice
had an enjoyable boyhood. As
far as we can see, going to church was
his sole recreation, as it was probably
the principal recreation of his master’s
daughter, whose hymn-book he shares,
and whom he duly marries. <i>Her</i> home-life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
doubtless bore a strong resemblance
to the home-life of the tumultuous heroine
of “Fanny’s First Play,” who tells us
with a heaving breast that she never knew
what a glorious thing life was until she
had knocked out a policeman’s tooth.
Hogarth’s young lady would probably
have cared little for this form of exercise,
even had the London policemen of 1748
been the chivalrous sufferers they were
in 1911. She is a buxom, demure damsel;
and in her, as in the lad by her side,
there is a suggestion of reserve power.
They are citizens in the making, prepared
to accept soberly the restrictions and responsibilities
of citizenship, and to follow
with relish the star of their own destinies.</p>

<p>And all things considered, what can be
better than to make a good job out of a
given piece of work? “That intricate web
of normal expectation,” which Mr. Gilbert
Murray tells us is the very essence
of human society, provides incentives for
reasonable men and women, and provides<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
also compensations for courage.
What Mr. Murray calls a “failure of
nerve” in Greek philosophy and Greek
religion is the relaxing of effort, the letting
down of obligation. With the asceticism
imposed, or at least induced, by
Christianity, “the sacrifice of one part of
human nature to another, that it may live
in what survives the more completely,”
he has but scant and narrow sympathy;
but he explains with characteristic clearness
that the ideals of Greek citizenship
withered and died, because of a weakening
of faith in normal human resistance.
“All the last manifestations of Hellenistic
religion betray a lack of nerve.”</p>

<p>It is with the best intentions in the
world that we Americans are now engaged
in letting down the walls of human
resistance, in lessening personal
obligation; and already the failure of
nerve is apparent on every side. We begin
our kindly ministrations with the
little kindergarten scholar, to whom work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
is presented as play, and who is expected
to absorb the elements of education without
conscious effort, and certainly without
compulsion. We encourage him to
feel that the business of his teacher is to
keep him interested in his task, and that he
is justified in stopping short as soon as
any mental process becomes irksome or
difficult. Indeed, I do not know why I permit
myself the use of the word “task,”
since by common consent it is banished
from the vocabulary of school. Professor
Gilman said it was a word which should
never be spoken by teacher, never heard
by pupil, and no doubt a kind-hearted
public cordially agreed with him.</p>

<p>The firm old belief that the task is a
valuable asset in education, that the
making of a good job out of a given
piece of work is about the highest thing
on earth, has lost its hold upon the world.
The firm old disbelief in a royal road to
learning has vanished long ago. All
knowledge, we are told, can be made so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
attractive that school-children will absorb
it with delight. If they are not absorbing
it, the teacher is to blame. Professor Wiener
tells us that when his precocious little
son failed to acquire the multiplication
tables, he took him away from school,
and let him study advanced mathematics.
Whereupon the child discovered the tables
for himself. Mrs. John Macy, well
known to the community as the friend
and instructor of Miss Helen Keller, has
informed a listening world that she does
not see why a child should study <i>anything</i>
in which he is not interested. “It
is a waste of energy.”</p>

<p>Naturally, it is hard to convince parents—who
have the illusions common
to their estate—that while exceptional
methods may answer for exceptional
cases (little William Pitt, for instance,
was trained from early boyhood to be a
prime minister), common methods have
their value for the rank and file. It is
harder still to make them understand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
that enjoyment cannot with safety be
accepted as a determining factor in education,
and that the mental and moral
discipline which comes of hard and perhaps
unwilling study is worth a mine of
pleasantly acquired information. It is
not, after all, a smattering of chemistry,
or an acquaintance with the habits
of bees, which will carry our children
through life; but a capacity for doing
what they do not want to do, if it be a
thing which needs to be done. They will
have to do many things they do not
want to do later on, if their lives are
going to be worth the living, and the
sooner they learn to stand to their guns,
the better for them, and for all those
whose welfare will lie in their hands.</p>

<p>The assumption that children should
never be coerced into self-control, and
never confronted with difficulties, makes
for failure of nerve. The assumption that
young people should never be burdened
with responsibilities, and never, under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
any stress of circumstances, be deprived
of the pleasures which are no longer a
privilege, but their sacred and inalienable
right, makes for failure of nerve.
The assumption that married women are
justified in abandoning their domestic
duties, because they cannot stand the
strain of home-life and housekeeping,
makes for failure of nerve. The assumption
that invalids must yield to invalidism,
must isolate themselves from common
currents of life, and from strong
and stern incentives to recovery, makes
for failure of nerve. The assumption that
religion should content itself with persuasiveness,
and that morality should
be sparing in its demands, makes for
failure of nerve. The assumption that a
denial of civic rights constitutes a release
from moral obligations makes for such
a shattering failure of nerve that it brings
insanity in its wake. And the assumption
that poverty justifies prostitution, or exonerates
the prostitute, lets down the last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
walls of human resistance. It is easier to
find a royal road to learning than a royal
road to self-mastery and self-respect.</p>

<p>A student of Mr. Whistler’s once said
to him that she did not want to paint
in the low tones he recommended; she
wanted to keep her colours clear and
bright. “Then,” replied Mr. Whistler,
“you must keep them in your tubes. It
is the only way.” If we want bright colours
and easy methods, we must stay in
our tubes, and avoid the inevitable complications
of life by careful and consistent
uselessness. We may nurse our
nerves in comfortable seclusion at home,
or we may brace them with travel and
change of scene. It does not matter; we
are tube-dwellers under any skies. We
may be so dependent upon amusements
that we never call them anything but
duties; or we may be as devout as La
Fontaine’s rat, which piously retired from
the society of other rats into the heart
of a Dutch cheese. We may be so rich<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
that the world forgives us, or so poor
that the world exonerates us. In each
and every case we destroy life at the
roots by a denial of its obligations, a
fear of its difficulties, an indifference to
its common rewards.</p>

<p>The seriousness of our age expresses
itself in eloquent demands for gayety.
The gospel of cheerfulness, I had almost
said the gospel of amusement, is preached
by people who lack experience to people
who lack vitality. There is a vague impression
that the world would be a good
world if it were only happy, that it would
be happy if it were amused, and that it
would be amused if plenty of artificial
recreation—that recreation for which
we are now told every community stands
responsible—were provided for its entertainment.</p>

<p>A few years ago an English clergyman
made an eloquent appeal to the
public, affirming that London’s crying
need was a score of “Pleasure-Palaces,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
supported by taxpayers, and free as the
Roman games. Gladiators being, indeed,
out of date, lions costly, and martyrs very
scarce, some milder and simpler form of
diversion was to be substituted for the
vigorous sports of Rome. Comic songs
and acrobats were, in the reverend gentleman’s
opinion, the appointed agents
for the regeneration of the London poor.
It is worthy of note that the drama did
not occur to him as a bigger and broader
pastime. It is worthy of note that the
drama is fast losing ground with the proletariat,
once its staunch upholders. A very
hard-thinking English writer, Mr. J. G.
Leigh, sees in the substitution of cheap
vaudeville for cheap melodrama an indication
of what he calls loss of stamina,
and of what Mr. Murray calls loss of
nerve. “When the sturdy melodrama,
with its foiled villainy and triumphant
virtue, ceases to allure, and people want
in its place the vulgar vapidities of
the vaudeville, we may be sure there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
is a spirit of sluggish impotence in the
air.”</p>

<p>To-day the moving pictures present
the most triumphant form of cheap entertainment.
They are good of their kind,
and there is a visible effort to make them
better; but the “special features” by
which they are accompanied in the ten-and
fifteen-cent shows,—the shrill songs,
the dull jokes, the clumsy clog-dances,—are
all of an incredible badness. Compared
with them, the worst of plays seems
good, and the ill-paid actors who storm
and sob through “Alone in a Great
City,” or “No Wedding Bells for Her,”
assume heroic proportions, as ministering
to the emotions of the heart.</p>

<p>The question of amusement is one
with which all classes are deeply concerned.
<i>Le Monde où l’on s’amuse</i> is no
longer the narrow world of fashion. It
has extended its border lines to embrace
humanity. It is no longer an exclusively
adult world. The pleasures of youth have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
become something too important for interference,
too sacred for denial. Whatever
may be happening to parents, whatever
their cares and anxieties, the sons
and daughters must lose none of the gayeties
now held essential to their happiness.
They are trained to a selfishness
which is foreign to their natures, and
which does them grievous wrong. A few
years ago I asked an acquaintance about
her mother, with whom she lived, and
who was, I knew, incurably ill. “She is
no better,” said the lady disconsolately,
“and I must say it is very hard on my
children. They cannot have any of their
young friends in the house. They cannot
entertain. They have been cut off from
all social pleasures this winter.”</p>

<p>I said it was a matter of regret, and
I forbore to add that the poor invalid
would probably have been glad to die
a little sooner, had she been given the
chance. It was not the mere selfishness
of old age which kept her so long about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
it. Yet neither was my acquaintance the
callous creature that she seemed. Left
to herself, she would not have begrudged
her mother the time to die; but she had
been deeply imbued with the conviction
that young people in general, and her
own children in particular, should never
be saddened, or depressed, or asked to
assume responsibilities, or be called upon
for self-denial. She was preparing them
carefully for that failure of nerve which
would make them impotent in the stress
of life.</p>

<p>The desire of the modern philanthropist
to provide amusement for the working-classes
is based upon the determination
of the working classes to be amused.
He is as keen that the poor shall have
their fill of dancing, as Dickens, in his
less enlightened age, was keen that the
poor should have their fill of beer. He
knows that it is natural for young men
and women to crave diversion, and that
it is right for them to have it. What<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
he does not clearly understand, what
Dickens did not clearly understand, is
that to crave either amusement or drink
so weakly that we cannot conquer our
craving, is to be worthless in a work-a-day
world.</p>

<p>And worse than worthless in a world
which is called upon for heroism and
high resolve. A cruel lesson taught by
the war is the degeneracy of the British
workman, who, in the hour of his country’s
need, has clung basely to his ease
and his sottishness. What does it avail
that English gentlemen fling away their
lives with unshrinking courage, when
the common people, from whose sturdy
spirit England was wont to draw her
strength, have shrivelled into a craven
apathy. The contempt of the British soldier
for the British artisan is not the contempt
of the fighting man for the man of
peace. It is the loathing of the man who
has accepted his trust for the man who
can do and bear nothing; who cries out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
if his drink is touched, who cries out if
his work is heavy, who cries out if his
hours are lengthened, who has parted
with his manhood, and does not want it
back. Whatever England has needed for
the regeneration of her sons, it was certainly
not “pleasure-palaces” and cheap
amusements. The “sluggish impotence”
which Mr. Leigh observed four years
ago, did not call, and does not call, for
relaxation. The only cure will be so stern
that no one cares to prophesy its coming.</p>

<p>And Americans! Well, thousands of
people bearing that name assembled in
New York on the 13th of November,
1915, under the auspices of the Woman’s
Peace Party, and amused themselves by
denouncing the Administration, howling
down all mention of national defence,
and jeering every time the word patriotism
(which we used to think a noble
word) was spoken in their hearing. Men
endeared themselves to the audience by
declaring that they would not risk their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
all too precious lives to fight for any
cause, and women intelligently asked
why a foreign rule would not be just as
good as a home one. They did not seem
aware that Brussels was having a less
enviable time than Boston or Milwaukee.
Profound foolishness swayed the
audience, abysmal ignorance soothed it.
There was an abundant showing of childish
irrationality; there was the apathy
which befits old age; but of intelligence
or of virility there was nothing.</p>

<p>This loss of nerve, this “weakening of
faith in normal human resistance,” means
the disintegration of citizenship. It is the
sudden call to manhood which shows us
where manhood is not to be found. We
Americans, begirt by sentiment, mindful
of our ease, and spared for more than
half-a-century from ennobling self-sacrifice,
have been seeking smooth and facile
methods of reform. The world, grown
old in ill-doing, responds nimbly to our
offers of amusement, but balks at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
austere virtues which no cajolery can
disguise. The more it is amused, the
more it assumes amusement to be its
due; and this assumption receives the
support and encouragement of those
whose experience must have taught
them its perils.</p>

<p>Miss Jane Addams, in her careful study
of the Chicago streets, speaks of the
“pleasure-loving girl who demands that
each evening shall bring her some measure
of recreation.” Miss Addams admits
that such a girl is beset by nightly dangers,
but does not appear to think her
attitude an unnatural or an unreasonable
one. A very able and intelligent
woman who has worked hard for the establishment
of decently conducted dance-halls
in New York,—dance-halls sorely
needed to supplant the vicious places of
entertainment where drink and degradation
walk hand in hand,—was asked at
a public meeting whether the girls for
whose welfare she was pleading never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
stayed at home. “Never,” was the firm
reply, “and will you pardon me for saying,
Neither do you.” The retort provoked
laughter, because the young married
woman who had put the question
probably never did spend a night at
home, unless she were entertaining. She
represented a social summit,—a combination
of health, wealth, beauty, charm
and high spirits. But there were scores
of girls and women in the audience
who spent many nights at home. There
are hundreds of girls and women in
what are called fashionable circles who
spend many nights at home. There are
thousands of girls and women in more
modest circumstances who spend many
nights at home. If this were not the case,
our cities would soon present a spectacle
of demoralization. They would be
chaotic on the surface, and rotten at the
core.</p>

<p>It is claimed that the nervous exhaustion
produced by hours of sustained and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
monotonous labour sends the factory
girl into the streets at night. She is too
unstrung for rest. That this is in a measure
true, no experienced worker will
deny, because every experienced worker
is familiar with the sensation. Every
woman who has toiled for hours, whether
with a sewing machine or a typewriter,
whether with a needle or a pen, whether
in an office or at home, has felt the
nervous fatigue which does not crave
rest but distraction, which makes her
want to “go.” Every woman worth her
salt has overcome this weakness, has
mastered this desire. It is probable that
many men suffer and struggle in the
same fashion. Dr. Johnson certainly did.
With inspired directness, he speaks of
people who are “afraid to go home and
think.” He knew that fear. Many a night
it drove him through the London streets
till daybreak. He conquered it, conquered
the sick nerves so at variance
with his sound mind and sound principles,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
and his example is a beacon light
to strugglers in the gloom.</p>

<p>Naturally, the working girl knows
nothing about Dr. Johnson. Unhappily,
she knows little of any beacon light or
guide. But, if she be a reasonable human
being, she <i>does</i> know that to expect
every evening to “bring her some measure
of recreation” is an utterly unreasonable
demand, and that it can be
gratified only at the risk of her physical
and moral undoing. She has been taught
to read in our public schools; she is provided
with countless novels and story-books
by our public libraries; the lightest
of light literature is at her command.
Is this not enough to tide her over a
night or two in the week? If her clothes
never need mending or renovating, she
is unlike any other woman the world has
got to show. If there is never any washing,
ironing, or housework for her to do,
her position is at once unusual and regrettable.
If she will not sometimes read,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
or work, or, because she is tired, go early
to bed; if her craving for amusement has
reached that acute stage when only the
streets, or the moving pictures, or the
dance-hall will satisfy it, she has so completely
lost nerve that she has no moral
stamina left. She may be virtuous, but
she is an incapable weakling, and the
working man who marries her ruins his
life. Such girls swell the army of deserted
wives which is the despair of all
organized charities.</p>

<p>The sincere effort to regenerate the
world by amusing it is to be respected;
but it is not the final word of reform.
The sincere effort to regenerate the world
by a legal regulation of wages is a new
version of an old story,—the shifting of
personal obligation, the search for somebody’s
door at which to lay the burden
of blame. It is also a denial of human
experience, inherited and acquired, and
a rejection of the only doctrine which
stands for self-respect: “Temptations do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
not make the man, but they show him
for what he is.” Qualities nourished by
this stern and sane doctrine die with the
withering of faith.</p>

<p>So much well-meant, but not harmless
nonsense—nonsense is never harmless—has
been preached concerning women
and their wages, that we are in the predicament
of Sydney Smith when Macaulay
flooded him with talk. We positively
“stand in the slops.” A professor of economics
in an American college offers out
of the fulness of his heart the following
specific and original remedy for existing
ills: “My idea is that one of the best
ways to get an increased remuneration
for women is to make them worth it.”</p>

<p>“My idea!” This is what it means
to have the scientific mind at work. A
unique proposition (what have we been
thinking about with our free schools for
the past hundred years?), unclogged by
detail, unhampered by ways and means.
And if we do not see salvation in truisms,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
if we are daunted by the gulf between
people who are theorizing and people
who are merely living, we can take refuge
with the reformers who demand
“increased remuneration for women”
whether they are worth it or not; who
would make the need of the worker, and
not the quality of the work, the determining
factor in wages. We may “protect
women from themselves,” by prohibiting
them from accepting less than their
legal hire.</p>

<p>The only real peril of a minimum wage-law
is that it has a tendency to relegate
the incompetent to beggary. It cannot,
as some economists claim, discourage
efficiency. Nothing can discourage efficiency,
which scorns help and defies hindrance.
But, by the same ruling, nothing
can command more than it is worth in
the markets of the world. We do wrong
when we release the worker from any
incentive to good work. We do wrong
when we release her from a sense of personal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
responsibility. We do wrong when
we give her a plausible excuse for following
the line of least resistance, when we
blight her courage by permitting her to
think that her moral welfare lies in any
hands but her own. The choice between
poverty and dishonesty, the choice between
poverty and prostitution is not an
“open question.” It is closed, if human
reason and human experience can speak
authoritatively upon any subject in the
world.</p>

<p>The injury done by loose thinking and
loose talking is irremediable. When the
State Senate Vice Investigating Committee
of Illinois permitted and encouraged
an expression of what it was pleased
to call the “shop-girl’s philosophy,” it
sowed the seeds of mischief deep enough
to insure a heavy crop of evil. I quote a
single episode, as it was reported in the
newspapers of March 8th, 1913,—a report
which, if inaccurate in detail, must
be correct in substance. A young woman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
who had been in the employ of
Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. was on the stand.
She was questioned by Lieutenant-Governor
O’Hara.</p>

<p>“‘If a girl were getting $8 a week, and
had to support a widowed mother, would
you blame that girl if she committed a
crime?’</p>

<p>“The witness looked up frankly, and
replied, ‘No, I wouldn’t.’</p>

<p>“‘Would you blame her if she killed
herself?’</p>

<p>“‘No, I wouldn’t,’ came the emphatic
reply.</p>

<p>“‘And would you blame her, if she
committed a greater crime?’</p>

<p>“The young Lieutenant-Governor’s
meaning was in his embarrassed tones
and in his heightened colour. The girl
was the more composed of the two. She
paused a moment, and then repeated distinctly,
‘No, I wouldn’t.’</p>

<p>“The room had been painfully quiet,
but at this there was a round of applause,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
led by the women spectators. It was the
first general spontaneous outburst of the
session. ‘Emily’ was then dismissed.”</p>

<p>Dismissed with the “round of applause”
ringing in her ears, and in her
mind the comfortable assurance that her
theory of life was a sound one. Also that
a warm-hearted public was prepared to
exonerate her, should she find a virtuous
life too onerous for endurance. Is it
likely that this girl, and hundreds of other
Emilys, thus encouraged to let down the
walls of resistance, can be saved from
the hopeless failure of nerve which will
relegate them to the ranks of the defeated?
Is it likely that the emotional
hysteria of the applauding audience, and
of hundreds of similar audiences, can be
reduced to reason by such sober statistics
as those furnished by the Bureau of
Social Hygiene in New York, or by the
New York State Reformatory for Women
at Bedford Hills? Less than three
per cent of seven hundred girls examined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
at the Bedford Hills reformatory
pleaded poverty, as a reason for their
fall; and, of this three per cent, more
than half had been temporarily out of
work. On the other hand, twenty per
cent were feeble-minded, were mentally
incapacitated for self-control, and as
much at the mercy of their instincts as
so many animals. These are the blame-less
unfortunates whom vice commissioners
seem somewhat disposed to ignore.
These are the women who should be
protected from themselves, and from
whose progeny the public should be protected.</p>

<p>It is evident that triumphant virtue
must have strong foundations. Income
and recreation are but slender props.
Becky Sharp was of the opinion that,
given five thousand pounds a year, she
could be as respectable as her neighbours;
but, in our hearts, we have always
doubted Becky. “Where virtue is
well rooted,” said the watchful Saint<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
Theresa, “provocations matter little.”
All results are in proportion to the greatness
of the spirit which has nourished
them. When Cromwell made the discomforting
discovery that “tapsters and
town apprentices” could not stand in
battle against the Cavaliers, he said to
his cousin, John Hampden, that he must
have men of religion to fight with men
of honour. He summoned these men of
religion, fired them with enthusiasm,
hardened them into consistency, and
within fourteen years the nations which
had mocked learned to fear, and the
name of England was “made terrible”
to the world.</p>

<p>For big issues we must have strong
incentives and compelling measures.
“Where the religious emotions surge
up,” says Mr. Gilbert Murray, “the
moral emotions are not far away.” Perhaps
the mighty forces which have winnowed
the world for centuries may still
prove efficacious. Perhaps the illuminating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
principles of religion, the ennobling
spirit of patriotism, the uncompromising
standards of morality, may do more to
stiffen our powers of resistance than lectures
on “Life as a Fine Art,” or papers
on “The Significance of Play,” and
“Amusement as a Factor in Man’s
Spiritual Uplift.” Perhaps the stable
government which ensures to the Industrious
Apprentice the reward of his own
diligence is more bracing to citizenship
than the zealous humanity which protects
the Idle Apprentice from the consequences
of his own ill-doing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Christianity_and_War">Christianity and War</h2>
</div>


<p>There are two disheartening
features in the attitude of Americans
toward the ruthless war
which has been waged in Europe for the
past two years. One is the materialism
of pacifists who ignore, and have steadily
ignored, the crucial question of right
and wrong, justice and injustice. The
other is the materialism of pious Christians
who lament the failure of Christianity
to reconcile the irreconcilable, to
preserve the long-threatened security of
nations.</p>

<p>When, at the request of President Wilson,
the first Sunday of October, 1914,
was set aside as a day of prayer for peace,—a
day of many sermons and of many
speeches,—prayers and sermons and
speeches all alluded to the war as though
it were the cholera or the plague, something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
simple of issue, the abatement
of which would mean people getting
better, the cure of which would mean
people getting well. The possibility of
a peace shameful to justice and disastrous
to civilization was carefully ignored.
The truth that death is better
than a surrender of all that makes life
morally worth the living, was never
spoken. This may be what neutrality
implies. We addressed the Almighty in
guarded language lest He should misunderstand
our position. We listened
respectfully when Secretary Bryan told
us that our first duty was to use what
influence we might have to hasten the
return of peace, without asking him to
be more explicit, to say what on earth
he would have had us do, and how—without
moving hand or foot—he would
have had us do it.</p>

<p>Since then, men of little faith have
kept dinning in our ears that religion is
eclipsed, that Gospel law lacks the substance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
of a dream, that Christian principles
are bankrupt in the hour of need,
that the only God now worshipped in
Europe is the tribal God who fights for
his own people, and that the structure
of love and duty, reared by centuries of
Christianity, has toppled into ruin. To
quote Professor Cramb’s classic phrase,
“Corsica has conquered Galilee.” Some
of these sad-minded prophets had fathers
and grandfathers who fought in the
Civil War, and they seem in no wise
troubled by this distressful fact. Some
of them had great-great-grandfathers
who fought in the Revolutionary War,
and <i>they</i> join high-sounding societies
out of illogical pride. Yet the colonists
who defended their freedom and their
new-born national life were not more
justified in shedding blood, than were
the French and Belgians and Serbians
who heroically defended their invaded
countries and their shattered homes.</p>

<p>When Mr. Carnegie thanked God<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
(through the medium of the newspapers)
that he lived in a brotherhood of nations,—“forty-eight
nations in one Union,”—he
forgot that these forty-eight nations,
or at least thirty-eight of them,
were not always a brotherhood. Nor was
the family tie preserved by moral suasion.
What we of the North did was to beat our
brothers over the head until they consented
to be brotherly. And some three
hundred thousand of them died of grievous
wounds and fevers rather than love
us as they should.</p>

<p>This was termed preserving the Union.
The abiding gain is visible to all men,
and it is not our habit to question the
methods employed for its preservation.
No one called or calls the “Battle Hymn
of the Republic” a cry to a tribal God,
although it very plainly tells the Lord
that his place is with the Federal, and
not with the Confederate lines. And
when the unhappy Belgians crowded the
Cathedral of St. Gudule, asking Heaven’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
help for defenceless Brussels, imploring
the intercession of our Lady of
Deliverance (pitiful words that wring the
heart!), was this a cry to a tribal God, or
the natural appeal of humanity to a power
higher and more merciful than man?
Americans returning from war-stricken
Europe in the autumn of 1914 spoke
unctuously of their country as “God’s
own land,” by which they meant a land
where their luggage was unmolested.
But it is possible that nations fighting
with their backs to the wall for all they
hold sacred and dear are as justified in
the sight of God as a nation smugly
content with its own safety, living
its round of pleasures, giving freely of
its superfluity, and growing rich with
the vast increase of its industries and
trade.</p>

<p>What influence has been at work since
the close of the Franco-Prussian War,
shutting our eyes to the certainty of that
war’s final issue, and debauching our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
minds with sentiment which had no truth
to rest on? We knew that the taxes of
Europe were spent on armaments, and
we talked about International Arbitration.
We knew that science was devotedly
creating ruthless instruments of destruction,
and we turned our pleased
attention to the beautiful ceremonies
with which the Peace Palace at The
Hague was dedicated. We knew, or we
might have known, that the strategic
railway built by Germany to carry troops
to the Belgian frontier was begun in
1904, and that the memorandum of General
Schlieffen was sanctioned by the
Emperor (there was no pretence of secrecy)
in 1909. Yet we thought—in
common with the rest of the world—that
a “scrap of paper” and a plighted
word would constitute protection. We
knew that Germany’s answer to England’s
proposals for a mutual reduction
of navies was an increase of estimates,
and a double number of dreadnoughts.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
Did we suppose these dreadnoughts were
playthings for the Imperial nurseries?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“A pretty toy,” quoth she, “the Thunderer’s bolt!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">My urchins play with it.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">When in 1911 President Taft’s “message”
was hailed as a prophecy of
peace, Germany’s reply was spoken by
Bethmann-Hollweg: “The vital strength
of a nation is the only measure of a nation’s
armaments.”</p>

<p>And now the good people who for
years have been saying that war is archaic,
are reproaching Christianity for
not making it impossible. Did not the
“American Association for International
Conciliation” issue comforting pamphlets,
entitled “The Irrationality of
War,” and “War Practically Preventable”?
That ought to have settled the
matter forever. Did we not appoint a
“Peace Day” for our schools, and a
“Peace Sunday” for churches and Sunday
schools? Did not Mr. Carnegie pay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
ten millions down for international peace,—and
get a very poor article for his
money? There were some beautiful papers
read to the Peace Congress at The
Hague, just twelve months before Europe
was in flames; and there is the report
of a commission of inquiry which
the “World Peace Foundation,” formerly
the “International School of
Peace,” informed us three years ago
was “a great advance toward assured
peaceful relations between nations.”</p>

<p>With this sea of sentiment billowing
about us, and with Nobel prizes dropping
like gentle rain from Heaven upon
thirsty peace-lovers, how should we read
the signs of war, written in the language
of artillery? It is true that President
Nicholas Murray Butler, speaking in
behalf of the Carnegie Peace Foundation,
observed musingly in November,
1913, that there was no visible interest
displayed by any foreign government,
or by any responsible foreign statesman,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
in the preparations for the Third Hague
Conference, scheduled for 1915; but this
was not a matter for concern. It was
more interesting to read about the photographs
of “educated and humane men
and women,” which the “World Conference
for Promoting Concord between
all Divisions of Mankind” (a title that
leaves nothing, save grammar, to be desired)
proposed collecting in a vast and
honoured album for the edification of the
peaceful earth.</p>

<p>And all this time England—England,
with her life at stake—shared our serene
composure. Lord Salisbury, indeed, and
Lord Roberts cherished no illusions concerning
Germany’s growing power and
ultimate intentions. But then Lord Roberts
was a soldier; and Lord Salisbury,
though outwitted in the matter of Heligoland,
had that quality of mistrust
which is always so painful in a statesman.
The English press preferred, on
the whole, to reflect the opinions of Lord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
Haldane. They were amiable and soothing.
Lord Haldane knew the Kaiser, and
deemed him a friendly man. Had he not
cried harder than anybody else at Queen
Victoria’s funeral? Lord Haldane had
translated Schopenhauer, and could afford
to ignore Treitschke. None of the
German professors with whom he was
on familiar terms were of the Treitschke
mind. They were all friendly men. It is
true that Germany, far from talking platitudes
about peace, has for years past defined
with amazing lucidity and candour
her doctrine that might is right. She is
strong, brave, covetous, she has what is
called in urbane language “the instinct
for empire,” and she follows implicitly</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">“The good old rule, ... the simple plan,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That they should take who have the power,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And they should keep who can.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">It was forlornly amusing to see, three
months after the declaration of war, our
book-shops filled with cheap copies of
General von Bernhardi’s bellicose volume;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
to open our newspapers, and find
column after column of quotation from
it; to pick up our magazines, and discover
that all the critics were busy discussing
it. That book was published in
1911, and the world (outside of Germany
which took its text to heart) remained
“more than usual calm.” Its forcible and
closely knit argument is defined and
condensed in one pregnant sentence:
“The notion that a weak nation has the
same right to live as a powerful nation
is a presumptuous encroachment on the
natural law of development.”</p>

<p>This is something different from the
suavities of peace-day orators. It is also
vastly different from the sentiments so
gently expressed by General von Bernhardi
in his more recent volume, dictated
by German diplomacy, and designed
as a tract for the United States
and other neutral nations. Soothing
syrup is not sweeter than this second
book; but its laboured explanations, its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
amiable denials, even the pretty compliment
paid us by a quotation from “A
Psalm of Life” (why ignore “Mary had
a little lamb”?), have failed to obliterate
the sharp, clear outlines of his pitiless
policy. Being now on the safe side of
prophecy, we wag our heads over the
amazing exactitude with which Bernhardi
forecast Germany’s impending
war. But there was at least one English
student and observer, Professor J. A.
Cramb of Queen’s College, London, who
gave plain and unheeded warning of the
fast-deepening peril, and of the life-or-death
struggle which England would be
compelled to face. Step by step he traced
the expansion of German nationalism,
which since 1870 has never swerved
from its stern military ideals. A reading
people, the Germans. Yes, and in a single
year they published seven hundred
books dealing with war as a science,—not
one of them written for a prize! If
the weakness of Germany lies in her assumption<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
that there is no such thing as
honour or integrity in international relations,
her strength lies in her reliance
on her own carefully measured efficiency.
Her contempt for other nations has kept
pace with the distrust she inspires.</p>

<p>The graceful remark of a Prussian official
to Matthew Arnold, “It is not so
much that we dislike England, as that
we think little of her,” was the expression
of a genuine Teutonic sentiment.
So, too, was General von Bernhardi’s
characteristic sneer at the “childlike”
confidence reposed by Mr. Elihu Root
and his friends in the Hague High Court
of International Justice, with public opinion
at its back. Of what worth, he asked,
is law that cannot be converted by force
into government? What is the weight of
opinion, unsupported by the glint of
arms? Professor Cramb, seeing in Bernhardi,
and in his great master, Treitschke,
the inspiration of their country’s
high ambition, told England in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
plainest words he could command that
just as the old German Imperialism began
with the destruction of Rome, so
would the new German Imperialism begin
with the destruction of England; and
that if Englishmen dreamed of security
from attack, they were destined to a terrible
and bloody awakening. Happily
for himself,—since he was a man too
old and ill to fight,—he died nine months
before the fulfilment of his prophecy.</p>

<p>Now that the inevitable has come to
pass, now that the armaments have been
put to the use for which they were always
intended, and the tale of battle is
too terrible to be told, press and pulpit
are calling Christianity to account for
its failure to preserve peace. Ethical societies
are reminding us, with something
which sounds like elation, that they have
long pointed out “the relaxed hold of
doctrine on the minds of the educated
classes.” How they love that phrase,
“educated classes,” and what, one wonders,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
do they mean by it? A Jewish
rabbi, speaking in Carnegie hall, laments,
or rejoices—it is hard to tell
which—that Christian Churches are not
taken, and do not take themselves, seriously.
Able editors comment in military
language upon the inability of religious
forces to “mobilize” rapidly and effectively
in the interests of peace, and turn
out neat phrases like “anti-Christian
Christendom,” which are very effective
in editorials. Popular preachers, too
broad-minded to submit to clerical authority,
deliver “syndicated sermons,”
denouncing the “creeds of the Dark
Ages,” which still, in these electricity-lighted
days, pander to war. Worse than
all, troubled men, seeing the world suddenly
bereft of justice and of mercy, lose
courage, and whisper in the silence of
their own sad hearts, “There is no God.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the assaulted churches
take, as is natural, somewhat conflicting
views of the situation. Roman Catholics<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
have been disposed to think that the
persecutions of the Church in France are
bearing bitter fruit; and at least one
American Cardinal has spoken of the
war as God’s punishment for this offence.
But if the Almighty appointed Belgium
to be the whipping boy for the sins of
France, we shall have to revise our notions
of divine justice and beneficence.
Belgium is the most Catholic country in
Europe. Hundreds of the priests and
nuns expelled from France found shelter
within its frontiers. But if it were as
stoutly Lutheran or Calvinistic, it would
be none the less innocent of France’s
misdemeanours. Moreover, it is worthy
of note that French priests, far from
moralizing over the situation, have rallied
to their country’s call. The bugbear,
“clerical peril,” has dropped out of sight.
In its place are confidence on the one
side, and unstinted devotion on the
other. Exiled monks have returned to
fight in the French army. Students of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
theological seminaries have been no less
keen than other students to take up arms
for France. Abbés have served as sergeants
and ensigns, dying as cheerfully
as other men in the monotonous carnage
on the Aisne. Wounded priests have
shrived their wounded comrades on the
battlefield. Everywhere the clergy are
playing manly and patriotic parts, forgetting
what wrong was done them, remembering
what name they bear.</p>

<p>England, with more precision, outlined
her views in the manifesto issued September
29, 1914, and designed as a reply
to those German theologians who had
asked English “Evangelical Christians”
to hold back their hands from blood-shed.
The manifesto was signed by
Bishops and Archbishops of the Church
of England, and by leading Nonconformists,
all of whom found themselves
for once in heartfelt amity. It is a plain-spoken
document, declaring that truth
and honour (it might have added safety)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
are better things than peace; and that
Christian England endorses without reservation
the rightness of the war. One
of the signers, the Bishop of London, is
chaplain to the London Rifle Brigade.
No doubt about <i>his</i> sentiments. The
words of another, the Archbishop of
York, are simple, sincere, and pleasantly
free from patronage of the Almighty. “I
dare to say that we can carry this cause
without shame or misgiving into the presence
of Him who is the Judge of the
whole earth, and ask Him to bless it.”</p>

<p>As for Germany, it may be, as some
enthusiasts assert, that her “creative
power in religion,” keeping pace with
her “genius for empire,” will turn her
out a brand-new faith, the “world-faith”
foreseen by Treitschke, a religion of
valour and of unceasing effort. Or it
may be that the God of her fathers will
content her, seeing that she leaves Him
so little to do. Like Cromwell, who was
a religious man (his thanksgiving for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
massacre at Drogheda was as heartfelt
as any offered by the Kaiser, or by the
Kaiser’s grandfather), Germany keeps
her powder dry.</p>

<p>Christianity and war have walked together
down the centuries. How could
it be otherwise? We have to reckon
with humanity, and humanity is not
made over every hundred years. Science
has multiplied instruments of destruction,
but the heart of the soldier
is the same. It is an anachronism, this
human heart, just as war is an anachronism,
but it still beats. Nothing
sacred and dear could have survived
upon the earth had men not fought for
their women, their homes, their individual
honour, and their national life.
And while men stay men, they must
give up their lives when the hour strikes.
How shall they believe that, dying on
the frontiers of their invaded countries,
or at the gates of their besieged towns,
they sin against the law of Christ?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>Heroism is good for the soul, and it
bears as much practical fruit as lawmaking.
It goes further in moulding
and developing the stuff of which a
great nation is made. “There is a flower
of honour, there is a flower of chivalry,
there is a flower of religion.” So Sainte-Beuve
equips the spirit of man; and the
soldier, no less than the civilian, cherishes
this threefold bloom. Because he
“lives dangerously,” he feels the need
of God. Because his life is forfeit, there
is about him the dignity of sacrifice.
Anna Robeson Burr, in her volume on
“The Autobiography,” quotes an illustrative
passage from the Commentaries
of that magnificent fighter and lucid
writer, Blaise de Monluc, maréchal de
France: “Que je me trouve, en voyant
les ennemis, en telle peur que je sentois le
cœur et les membres s’affoiblir et trembler.
Puis, ayant dit mes petites prières
latines, je sentois tout-à-coup venir un
chaleur au cœur et aux membres.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>“Petites prières latines!” A monkish
patter. And this was a man belonging to
the “educated classes,” and a citizen of
the world. Sully, in his memoirs, tells us
that, at the siege of Montmélian, a cannon-shot
struck the ground close to the
spot where he and the king were standing,
showering upon them earth and little
flint stones; whereupon Henry swiftly
and unconsciously made the sign of the
cross. “Now I know,” said the delighted
Sully,—himself an unswerving Protestant,—“now
I know that you are a good
Catholic.”</p>

<p>We must always reckon with humanity,
unless, indeed, we are orators, living
in a world of words, and marshalling
unconquerable theories against unconquered
facts. The French priest at Soissons
who distributed to the Turcos little
medals of the Blessed Virgin may not
have been an advanced thinker, but he
displayed a pleasant acquaintance with
mankind. There was no time to explain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
to these unbelievers the peculiar efficacy
of the medals; for that he trusted to Our
Lady; but their presentation was a link
between the Catholic soldier and the
Moslem, who were fighting side by side
for France. Perhaps this priest remembered
that close at hand, in the hamlet
of Saint-Médard, lie the relics of Saint
Sebastian, Christian gentleman and martyr,
who was an officer in the imperial
bodyguard of Diocletian, rendering to
Cæsar the service that was Cæsar’s, until
the hour came for him to render to God
the life that was always God’s.</p>

<p>The wave of religious emotion which
sweeps over a nation warring for its life
is not the mere expression of that nation’s
sharpened needs; it is not only a
cry for help where help is sorely needed.
It is part of man’s responsiveness to the
call of duty, his sense of self-sacrifice in
giving his body to death in order that
his country may live. “Religion,” says
Mr. Stephen Graham, “is never shaken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
down by war. The intellectual dominance
is shaken and falls; the spiritual powers
are allowed to take possession of men’s
beings.” That a truth so simple and so
often illustrated should fail to be understood,
proves the torpor of materialism.
A sad-minded American writer, commenting
on the destruction of the Cathedral
of Rheims, made the amazing discovery
that the sorrow and indignation
evoked by this national crime showed
an utter collapse of Christianity. Every
one, he said, bewailed the loss to the
world. No one bewailed the loss to religion.
Therefore faith lay dead.</p>

<p>That religion can lose nothing by the
destruction of her monuments is the solace
of Christian souls. Her churches lie
in crumbling ruins. Ypres, Pervyse, Soissons,
Revigny, Souain, Maurupt, Étavigny.
Everywhere stand the shattered
walls of what was once a church, with
here and there an altar burned or hacked,
and a mutilated crucifix. But the faith<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
that built these churches is as unassailable
as the souls of the men who died
for them. There are things beyond the
reach of “high explosives,” and it is not
for them we grieve.</p>

<p>It is a common saying that the New
Testament affords no vindication of war,
which is natural enough, not being
penned as a manual for nations. But
Catholic theology, having been called
on very early to pronounce judgment
upon this recurrent incident of life, has
defined with absolute exactitude what,
in the eyes of the Church, justifies, and
what necessitates war. From a mass of
minute detail,—laws laid down by Saint
Thomas Aquinas and other doctors of
the Church,—I venture to quote two
salient points, the first dealing with the
nature of a right, the second with the
nature of a title.</p>

<p>“Every perfect right, that is, every
right involving in others an obligation
in justice of deference thereto, if it is to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
be an efficacious, and not an illusory
power, carries with it as a last appeal
the subsidiary right of coercion. A perfect
right, then, implies the right of physical
force to defend itself against infringement,
to recover the subject-matter of
right unjustly withheld, or to exact its
equivalent, and to inflict damage in the
exercise of this coercion, wherever coercion
cannot be exercised without such
damage.”</p>

<p>“The primary title of a state to go to
war is, first, the fact that the state’s rights
are menaced by foreign aggression not
otherwise to be prevented than by war;
second, the fact of actual violation of
right not otherwise reparable; third, the
need of punishing the threatening or invading
power, for the security of the
future. From the nature of the proved
right, those three facts are necessarily
just titles, and the state whose rights are
in jeopardy is itself the judge thereof.”</p>

<p>I am aware that theology is not popular,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
save with theologians; but after
reading Treitschke and Bernhardi on
the one hand, and the addresses delivered
at “peace demonstrations” on the
other, it is inexpressibly refreshing to follow
straight thought instead of crooked
thought, or words that hold no thought
at all. I am also aware that Catholic
wars have not always been waged along
the lines laid down by Catholic theology;
but this is beside the point. The Mosaic
law was not the less binding upon the
Jews because they were always breaking
it. Nor are we prepared to say that they
would have been as sound morally without
a law so constantly infringed. It is
well to know that, even in the spirit,
there is such a thing as justice and admitted
right.</p>

<p>To prate about the wickedness of war
without drawing a clear line of demarcation
between aggressive and defensive
warfare, between violating a treaty and
upholding it, is to lose our mental balance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
to substitute sentiment for truth.
The very wrongness of the one implies
logically the rightness of the other. And
whatever is morally right is in accord
with Christianity. To speak loosely of
war as unchristian is to ignore not only
the Christian right, but the Christian
duty, which rests with every nation and
with every man to protect that of which
nation and man are lawful protectors.
Even aggressive warfare is not necessarily
a denial of the Christianity it affronts.
Crooked thinking comes naturally to
men, and the power of self-deception is
without bounds. God is not deceived;
but the instinctive desire of the creature
to hoodwink the Creator, to induce Him—for
a consideration—to compound a
felony, is revealed in every page of history,
and under every aspect of civilization.
The necessity which man has always
felt of being on speaking terms
with his own conscience, built churches
and abbeys in the days of faith, and endows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
educational institutions in this day
of enlightenment; but it very imperfectly
controlled, or controls, the actions
of men or of nations. If our confidence
in the future were not based upon ignorance
of the past, we should better understand,
and more courageously face,
the harsh realities of life.</p>

<p>Two lessons taught by the war are
easily learned. There is no safety in talk,
and there is no assurance that the world’s
heritage of beauty, its triumphs of art
and of architecture, will descend to our
children and our grandchildren. We
never reckoned on this loss of our common
inheritance. We never thought that
the gracious gifts made by the far past
to the dim future could be so speedily
destroyed, and that a single day would
suffice to impoverish all coming generations.
What can the pedantry, the “culture,”
of the twentieth century give to
compensate us for the loss of Rheims
Cathedral? The deficit is too heavy to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
be counted. Not France alone, but the
civilized world, has been robbed beyond
measure and beyond retrievement. Life
is less good to all of us, and will be less
good to those who come after us, because
this great sacrilege has been committed.
As for culture,—the careful destruction
of the University of Louvain
proves once and forever that scholarship
is no more sacred than art or than
religion, when the tide of invasion breaks
upon a doomed and helpless land.</p>

<p>This affords food for thought. Italy,
for example, is the treasure-house of the
world. She is the guardian of the beauty
she created, and to her shrine goes all
mankind in pilgrimage. How long would
her cathedrals, her palaces, her galleries,
survive assault? What would be left of
Venice after a week’s bombardment?
What of Florence, or of Rome? There is
no such thing as safety in war. There
is no such thing as safety in neutrality.
Italy has more to lose than all the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
nations of Europe, and is there one of
us who would not be a partner in her
loss?</p>

<p>And the United States? “God’s own
land”? Are we forever secure? True we
have little to fear in the destruction of
our public monuments, which are rather
like the public monuments of Prussia,
the ornate edifices and ramping statues
of Hamburg and Berlin. It might be a
pious duty to let them go. But we have
homes which are as precious to us as
were once the devastated homes of Belgium
to happy men and women; and
we confide their safety to treaties, to
scraps of paper, like the one which made
Belgium inviolate. If we are in search of
life’s ironies, let us note that a Roman
Catholic Peace Conference was to have
been convened in Liège, the very month
that Germany struck her blow. A fortnight’s
delay, and delegates might have
been making speeches on the concord
of nations, while the streets of Aerschot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
ran blood, and Wespelaer was looted
and burned.</p>

<p>Yet so deep-rooted is sentiment in our
souls, so averse are we to facing facts,
that to-day a “peace meeting” will pack
a convention hall in any town of any
state in the Union. We are as pleased
to hear that “the brotherhood of man is
the only basis for enduring peace among
the nations” as if this shadowy brotherhood
had taken form and substance. We
listen with undiminished trustfulness to
Mr. Bryan’s oft-repeated plans for ending
the war by remonstrating soberly
with the warriors. We see hope in conferences,
in speeches, in telegrams to Washington,
in appeals “from the mothers of
the nation.” How many months have
passed since Mr. La Follette evoked our
enthusiastic response to these well-timed,
well-balanced words? “The accumulated
and increasing horrors of the European
wars are creating a great tidal wave of
public opinion that sweeps aside all specious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
reasoning, and admits of but one
simple, common-sense, humane conclusion,—a
demand for peace and disarmament
among civilized nations.”</p>

<p>To this we all cried Amen! But as
there was nobody to bell the cat, the
war went bloodily on. The question who
was to “demand” peace, and of whom
it was to be demanded, was one which
Mr. La Follette could not, or at least
did not, answer. “Public opinion” has
a weighty sound. All our lives we have
pinned our faith to this bodiless thing,
and it has failed us in our need. Why,
if it can work miracles in the future,
should it have been so helpless in these
two sad years? The Hague Conference
of 1907 laid down definite rules of warfare,—rules
to which the nations of Europe
subscribed with cheerful unanimity.
They forbade pillage, the levying of indemnities,
the seizure of funds belonging
to local authorities, collective penalties
for individual acts, the conveying of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
troops or munitions across the territory
of a neutral power, and all terrorization
of a country by harshness to its civilian
population. The object of these rules,
every one of which has been broken in
Belgium, was to keep war within the
limits set by what Mr. Henry James
calls the “high decency” of Christian
civilization. Public opinion has been as
powerless to enforce the least of these
rules as it has been powerless to prevent
the sinking of unarmed merchant ships,
the drowning of men, women and children
belonging to neutral nations. How
can we hope that a force so feeble to-day
will control the world to-morrow?</p>

<p>If the Allies emerge triumphantly from
the war, and England demands the reduction
of armaments, then this good
result will have been gained by desperate
fighting, not by noble sentiments.
We, whose sentiments have been of the
noblest, shall have had no real share in
the work. If Germany conquers, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
stands unassailable, a great military
world-power, fired with a sense of her
exalted destiny, rich with the spoils of
Europe, and holding in her mailed hands
the power to enforce her will, is it at all
likely that our excellent arguments will
prevail upon her to reverse her policy,
and enfeeble herself for our safety? A
successful aggressive warfare does not
pave the way to a lasting and honourable
peace. This is one of the truths we
may learn, if we will, from history.</p>

<p>For years we have chosen to believe
that arbitration would ensure for the
world a maximum of comfort at a minimum
of cost, and that the religion of
humanity would achieve what the religion
of Christ has never achieved,—the
mythical brotherhood of man. From
this dream we have been rudely awakened;
but, being awake, let us at least
recognize and respect that simple and
great quality which makes every man
the defender of his home, the guardian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
of his rights, the avenger of his shameful
wrongs.</p>

<p>We, too, have fought bravely in our
day. We, too, have known what it is to
do all that man can do, and to bear all
that man must bear; and it was not in
the hour of our trial that we talked
about bankrupt Christianity. When Serbia
made her choice between death and
the uttermost dishonour, she vindicated
the sacred right of humanity. When Belgium
with incredible courage defended
her own good name and the safety of
France, she stood erect before God and
man, and laid down her life for her
friend.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Women_and_War">Women and War</h2>
</div>


<p>The only agreeable thing to be
recorded in connection with
Europe’s sudden and disastrous
war is the fact that people stopped talking
about women, and began to talk
about men. For the past decade, women
have persistently occupied the front of
the stage, and men have seemed a negligible
factor; useful in their imperfect
way, but hopelessly unproblematic. Then
Austria delivered her ultimatum, Germany
marched her armies across a
peaceful earth, and men, plain men, became
supremely important, as defenders
of their imperilled homes. In this swift
return to primitive conditions, primitive
qualities reasserted their value. France,
Belgium, England called to their sons
for succour, and the arms of these men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
were strengthened because they had
women to protect.</p>

<p>A casual study of newspapers before
and after the proclamation of war is
profoundly instructive. Even the illustrated
papers and periodicals tell their
tale, and spare us the printed page. Pictures
of recruits in place of club-women.
Pictures of camps in place of convention
halls. Pictures of Red Cross nurses
bending over hospital beds, in place of
militants raiding Buckingham Palace.
Pictures of peaceful ladies sewing and
knitting for soldiers, in place of formidable
committees baiting Mr. Wilson,
or pursuing the more elusive Mr. Asquith.
Pictures of pitying young girls
handing cups of broth and the ever-welcome
cigarettes to weary volunteers, in
place of suffragists haranguing the mob
of Hyde Park. Never was there such a
noteworthy illustration of Scott’s archaic
line,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“O woman! in our hours of ease.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>
<p class="p0">Never did the simplicities of life so triumphantly
efface its complexities.</p>

<p>As the war deepened, and the tale of
its devastations and brutalities robbed
even the saddened onlooker of all gladness
in life, it was natural that women,
while faithful to their rôle of ministering
angels, should mingle blame with
pity. It was also natural, though less
pardonable, that their censure should
be of that vague order which holds
everybody responsible for what somebody
has done. Perhaps it was even
natural that, confident in their own unproved
wisdom and untried efficiency,
they should believe and say that, had
women shared the control of civilized
governments, the world would now be
at peace.</p>

<p>Here we enter the realms of pure conjecture,—realms
in which everything
can be asserted and denied, nothing
proved or disproved. It may be that
when women become voters, legislators,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
and officeholders, they will do the better
work for this profound and touching belief
in their own perfectibility. Or it may
be that a perilous self-confidence will—until
corrected by experience—lead
them astray. These speculations would
be of small concern, were it not that the
claim to moral superiority, which women
advance without a blush, disposes many
of them to ignore the hard conditions
under which men struggle, and fail, and
struggle again. It narrows their outlook,
confuses their judgment, and cheapens
their point of view.</p>

<p>When a prominent American feminist
said smartly that war is the hysteria of
men, she betrayed that lamentable lack
of perspective which ignorance can only
partly excuse. The heartless shallowness
of such a speech commended it to many
hearers; but of all generalizations it is
the least legitimate. There was as little
hysteria in the well-ordered, deeply laid
plans of Germany as there was in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
heroic defence of France and Belgium,
or in the slow awakening of England,
who took a deal of rousing from her
sleep. “Most women,” says Mr. Martin
Chaloner, “regard politics as a kind of
foolishness that men play at.” But the
campaign in Belgium is not to be classed
as “foolishness” or “hysteria.” The
attack was a crime past all forgiveness;
the defence was one of flawless valour.
If it be hysterical to prize home and
country more than life, then we must re-write
that temperate old axiom which
has swayed men’s souls for centuries:
“Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Pethick Lawrence, an English-woman
and an advanced feminist, has
devoted many busy months to persuading
American women that the incapacity
of men to rule the world is abundantly
proven by the present state of Europe,
and that the downfall of all that civilization
has held dear is due to their arrogant
rejection of feminine advice. Women,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
she asserts, are the “natural custodians
of the human race”; they have for years
“sought to find entrance into the councils
of the human commonwealth, in
order that they might there represent the
supreme issue of race-preservation and
development”; now at last their hands
must be free “to build up a surer and
safer structure of humanity.”</p>

<p>“To-day it is for men to stand down,
and for the women whom they have belittled
to take the seat of judgment. No
picture, however overdrawn, of woman’s
ignorance, error, or folly could exceed in
fantastic yet tragic horror the spectacle
which male governments are furnishing
history to-day. The foundation of the
structure of civilization which they have
erected in Europe has proved rotten.
The edifice, seemingly so secure, has
collapsed. The failure of male statecraft
in Europe is complete.”</p>

<p>This is a bitter indictment, and one not
to be lightly disregarded. But its terms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
are too general to support an argument.
What could the women of Belgium and
the women of France have done to save
their countries from invasion? When we
are told that “the woman-movement and
war cannot flourish together,” and that
we should never have witnessed this
“campaign of race-suicide,” had women
been justly represented, we have no answer
to make, because a denial would be
as hypothetical as is the assertion. But
when Mrs. Lawrence ventures to call the
war “a great dog-fight,” caused by an
“obsession of materialism,” we recognize
a smallness of vision and coarseness of
speech incompatible with clear thinking,
or with that distinction of mind which
commands attention and respect. If this
militant pacifist sees in the conduct of
England and in the conduct of France
only the greed of two dogs, squabbling
with Germany over a bone, which apparently
belongs to none of them, we can
but hope she is not expressing the views,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
or illustrating the knowledge of her countrywomen.</p>

<p>Great events, however lamentable, must
be looked at greatly. There is much to
be commended in the peace platform endorsed
by the suffragists in Washington,
January, 1915. There is everything to be
hoped for in the sane and just settlement
of national disputes by an international
tribunal, which might advantageously include
women representatives. The decisions
of such a tribunal must, however, be
supported by something stronger than
sentiment, which has proved singularly
inefficacious in the past. It is well that
men and women should work hand in
hand for peace and for prosperity; but it
is not well that women should invite themselves
to “take the seat of judgment”;
or that they should be complacently sure
that their arguments would have prevailed,
when similar arguments, advanced
by men, have been unheeded.</p>

<p>What, after all, is the line of reasoning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
which Mrs. Lawrence sincerely believes
would have swayed the councils of the
nations? After assuring us that “the woman’s
movement is spiritual and religious,
founded on the belief that human
life is sacred,” she continues: “As mothers,
women would have impressed upon
men the cost of human replenishment;
as chancellors of the family exchequer,
their influence would have been felt in
forcing legislatures to recognize the direct
relation between the plenteousness
of the food-supply, endangered and restricted
by war, and the health and growth
of the rising generation.”</p>

<p>If this is not “an obsession of materialism,”
where shall we look for such a quality?
The world has not waited until now
to learn the cost of war. It was one of the
stock arguments urged upon every conference
at The Hague. It was one of the
indubitable facts upon which we all relied
to keep the nations at peace. And it has
failed us, as materialism always does fail<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
us in every great national crisis. Germany
knows the cost of war, but she is out for
conquest, and the spoils of conquest. She
recalls with pleasure the two hundred
million pounds extorted from France in
1871, she hopes this time to “bleed her
white” (Bismarck’s cruel phrase is a compendium
of Prussian policy), she dangles
before German eyes the promise of indemnities
which will make good all losses,
and she enjoys a foretaste of bliss by levying
ruinous fines upon French and Flemish
towns which have tasted the utmost
bitterness of defeat. France knows the
cost of war, and is ill prepared to pay it;
but her alternative is yielding her soil,
and all she holds sacred and dear, to a
ruthless invader. Even a nation of Quakers,
or, we hope, a nation with women in
“the seat of judgment,” would reject submission
on such terms. England knows
the cost of war, but she also knows the
cost of German supremacy. She is at last
aware that her national life is at stake.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
She must fight to preserve it, or sink into
insignificance,—her glorious past as
much a thing of memory as is the past
of Rome.</p>

<p>For all these reasons the nations are
spending their money on armaments,
and spilling their blood on the battlefield.
The sacredness of life is being violated;
but is it life, or is it the moral worth of
life, which we hold sacred? Life is a thing
given us for a few years. Its only value
lies in the use we make of it. Lose it we
must, and very soon. But honour and
duty are for all time. Why do we see a
“soldiers’ monument” in nearly every
town of every state which fought for the
Union? Not because these men lived,
but because they died. What must it have
cost Mr. Lincoln, whose heart was big
enough for much suffering, to order from
an exhausted country the last draft of half
a million men! And why does an ingenious
writer, like Mr. G. Lowes Dickinson,
cudgel his brain to find abstract causes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
for war? The concrete causes which have
come within the personal experiences of
most of us will answer our rational questionings.</p>

<p>If it were possible that the women of
all nations could ever be brought to think
and feel alike,—a miracle of unity never
vouchsafed to men,—then they might
run the world harmoniously. If, for example,
a Frau Professor Treitschke, a
Frau General von Bernhardi, and the
more august spouse of the Chancellor
Bethmann-Hollweg had succeeded in
talking down their martial husbands, and
persuading Germany that her duty was
to breed in peace within her own frontier,
then a Madame Poincaré, a Madame
Joffre, a Mrs. Asquith, a Lady Kitchener
would have had no difficulty in holding
back France and England from war. If
the Kaiserin were an autocratic “peace-lady,”
ruling her “war-lord” into submission,
then the Queen of England and
the Queen of Belgium might be drinking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
tea with her to-day. But unless the good
Teuton women had kept their men at
home, how could the good French and
Belgian women have warded off attack?
And would the good British women have
said, “We are safe for a little while. Let
us stand cringing by, and see injustice
done”?</p>

<p>The “Woman’s Journal” wrote a year
ago to a number of more or less distinguished
people, and asked them if they
thought that woman suffrage would abolish,
or would lessen war. As none of these
more or less distinguished people had any
data upon which to build an opinion, their
answers were interesting, only as expressing
personal views of a singularly untrammelled
order. There were those who
believed that the Spartan mother stood
for an undying type, and there were those
who believed that she had been finally
and happily superseded. Miss Jane Addams
wrote that more women than men
“recognize the folly and wickedness of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
war,”—an easy generalization. Dr. Stephen
S. Wise, an unblinking enthusiast,
held that one great gain will follow the
tragic conditions of to-day. We shall see
the end of “man-made government.”
“World peace” and “world welfare”
will come with woman’s rule. Miss Mary
Johnston was of the opinion that “war
has still a fascination for most men,” but
that few women feel its seduction.</p>

<p>Miss Johnston’s view is the only one
which invites comment, because it is
shared by a great many women who have
not her excuse. “The Long Roll” and
“Cease Firing” are pretty grim pictures
of battle, but there is a heroic quality
about both books; while in that jolly,
chivalrous, piratical romance, “To Have
and to Hold,” combat follows combat
with dizzy speed and splendour. Miss
Johnston’s heroes take so kindly to fighting
that she naturally believes in the impelling
power of war; but, outside the
covers of a historical novel, the martial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
instinct is not a common one. It exists,
and it crops up where we least expect to
find it,—in professors of political economy,
in doctors who have spent their
existence keeping people alive, and in
clergymen who preach the religion of the
meek. But it is too rare to be a controlling
force, and it had little or no place in
the hearts of the thousands of men who
were marched to their deaths on the
battlefields of Poland and Flanders.</p>

<p>It was not the fascination of war that
brought the Tyrolean and Bavarian
peasants down from their mountain
farms. What did these men know or
care about Belgrade, or Prussia’s wide
ambitions? What to them was “the
fate-appointed world-task of Germany,
under the sacred dynasty of the Hohenzollern”?
They were summoned,
and they obeyed the summons. If the
women who talk so glibly about the
pleasure men take in fighting had seen
these conscripts saying good-bye to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
their wives and children, and marching
off, grave, silent, sad, they might revise
their notions of military enthusiasm.
Madame Rosika Schwimmer of Budapest
said before a convention in Nashville
that, had her countrywomen been
represented in the government, there
would have been no war. The remark
was received with an enthusiasm which
indicates some ignorance concerning
Hungary’s position and power. But did
Madame Schwimmer’s audience believe
that <i>all</i> her countrywomen hated war,
and <i>all</i> her countrymen desired it? And
how many of these countrymen, did
Nashville think, had any choice in the
matter?</p>

<p>When we turn from the attack to
the defence, from the assailants to the
assailed, we find as little room for “fascination”
as for peace. The war was
carried with incredible vigour and speed
to the thresholds of French and Belgian
homes. It was not precisely a tournament,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
in which battle-loving knights
rode prancing and curveting to the fray.
It was the older and simpler story of a
land swept by invasion, and of men
fighting and dying for all that belonged
to them on earth. Do the American
women who prate about the wrong done
to womanhood by war ever reflect that
it is for wife and child, as well as for
home and country, that men are bound
to die? What history do they read which
does not teach them this truth, which
does not tell it over and over again, to
interpret the story of the nations?</p>

<p>In the town of Lexington, Massachusetts,
where was shed the first blood
spilled in the Revolution, there slept
peacefully on the morning of April 19,
1775, a young man named Jonathan
Harrington. To him in the early dawn
came his widowed mother, who aroused
him, saying, “Jonathan, Jonathan, wake
up! The Regulars are coming, and
something must be done.” The something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
to be done was plain to this young
American, who had never fought, nor
seen fighting, in his life. He rose, dressed,
took his musket, joined the little group
of townsmen on the Common, and fell
before the first volley fired by the British
soldiers. His wife (he had been married
less than a year) ran to the door. He
crawled across the Common, bleeding
heavily, and died on his threshold at her
feet.</p>

<p>It is a very simple incident, and it
holds all the elements which make for
national life. A cause to support, a man
to support it, a woman to call for help
when the supreme moment comes. Something
like it must have happened over
and over again in the blood-soaked land
of Belgium. Yet we find women to-day
talking and writing as if none of their
sex had anything at stake in the defence
of their violated homes, as if they had no
sacred rights bound up with the sacred
rights of men. The National American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
Woman Suffrage Association sent an
appeal to organized suffragists all over
the world, urging them to “arise in protest,
and show war-crazed men that between
the contending armies there stand
thousands of women and children who
are the innocent victims of man’s unbridled
ambitions.”</p>

<p>There was no word in this appeal to
indicate that any nobler—and humbler—sentiment
than unbridled ambition
(which, after all, is for the very few) animates
the soldier’s heart. There was no
distinction drawn between aggressive
and defensive warfare. There was no
hint that men bear their full share of the
sufferings caused by war. The assumption
that women endure all the pain is
in accordance with the assumption that
men enjoy all the pleasure. To write as
though battle were a game, played by
men at the expense of women, is childish
and irrational. We Americans are
happily spared the sight of mangled soldiers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
lying in undreamed-of agony on
the frozen field. We do not see the
ghastly ambulance trains jolting along
with their load of broken, tortured men;
or the hospitals where these wrecks are
nursed back to some poor remnant of
life, or escape through the merciful gates
of death. But we might read of these
things; we might visualize them in moments
of comfortable leisure, and take
shame to our souls at the platform eloquence
which so readily assumes that
the sorrows of war are hidden in women’s
hearts, that the burdens of war are
laid upon women’s shoulders, that women
are sacrificed in their helplessness
to the hatred and the ambitions, the
greed and the glory of men.</p>

<p>If by any chance a word of regret is expressed
for the soldier who dies for his
country, it is always because he is the
son of his mother, or the husband of his
wife, or the father of his child. He is
never permitted an entity of his own. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
is curious that the same women who
clamour for a recognition of their individual
freedom should assume these property
rights in men. Dr. Anna Shaw has
commented sarcastically upon a habit
(one of many bad habits) which she has
observed in the unregenerate sex. They
speak of their womenkind in terms of relationship;
they use the possessive case.
They say, “my wife,” “my sister,” “my
daughter,” “my mother,” “my aunt,”
instead of “Jane,” “Susan,” “Mary
Ann,” “Mrs. Smith,” “Miss Jones.” Apparently
Dr. Shaw does not hear women
say, “my husband,” “my brother,” “my
son,” “my father,” “my uncle”; or, if
she does, this sounds less feudal in her
ears. Advanced feminists have protested
against the custom of “branding a woman
at marriage with her husband’s
name.” Even the convenience of such an
arrangement fails to excuse its arrogance.</p>

<p>Yet we are bidden to protest against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
the wickedness of all war, not because
men die, but because wives are widowed;
not because men slay, but because mothers
are childless; not because men do
evil, or suffer wrong, but because, in
either case, women share the consequences.
For the sake of these women,
war must cease, is the cry; as though
the vast majority of men would not be
glad enough to be rid of war for their
own sake. They do not covet loss of income
and destruction of property. They
do not gladly aspire to an armless or legless
future. Not one of them really wants
a shattered thigh, or a bullet in his abdomen.
And, in addition to these (perhaps
selfish) considerations, we might do
them the justice to remember that they
are not destitute of natural affection for
their wives and children; but that, on
the contrary, the safeguarding of the family
is, and has always been, a powerful
factor in war. It lent a desperate courage
to the Belgian soldier who saw his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
home destroyed; it nerved the arm of the
French soldier who knew his home in
peril. The killing of the first women and
children at Scarborough sent a host of
tardy volunteers into the British army.
Such indiscriminate slaughter, though
it represents a negligible loss to a nation,
is about the only thing on earth
which the least valiant men cannot stomach.</p>

<p>The Lusitania children, lying in pitiful
rows to await identification in Queenstown,
little meek and sodden corpses
buffeted out of comeliness by the waves,
awoke in the hearts of the men who
looked at them a passion of anger and
hate which life is too short to appease.
The brutal shooting of an English nurse
was followed by an illogical rush of young
Englishmen to the colours. And the mere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
fact that scores of writers, commenting
on Edith Cavell’s death, harkened back
to the beheading of Alice Lisle, proves
the imperishable nature of the infamy
attached to a deed, which to Judge Jeffreys,
as to General Baron von Bissing,
seemed the most reasonable thing in the
world.</p>

<p>The outbreak of the war was seized
upon as a strong argument for diametrically
opposite views. A small and
hardy minority kicked up its heels and
shouted, “Women cannot fight. Why
should they control a land they are
powerless to defend?” A large and sentimental
majority lifted up its eyes to
Heaven, and answered, “If women had
possessed their rights, all would now be
smiling and at peace.” And neither of
these contending factions took any trouble
to ascertain and understand the rights
and wrongs of the conflict. People who
pin their faith to a catchword never feel
the necessity of understanding anything.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span></p>

<p>Here, for example, is a violent pacifist
in the “Woman’s Journal,” who, to the
oft-repeated assertion that women, when
they have the vote, “will compel governments
to settle their disputes before
an international court of arbitration,”
adds this unwarranted statement: “The
women of the world have no quarrel
with one another. They do not care
whether or not Austria maintains its
power over the Balkan States; whether
or not France obtains revenge for the
defeats of 1870; whether Germany or
England gains supremacy in the world
market.”</p>

<p>This good lady does not seem to know
what happened in August, 1914. France
did not proclaim war upon Germany.
Germany proclaimed war upon France.
France did not attack,—for revenge, or
for any other motive. She was attacked,
and has been fighting ever since with
her back to the wall in defence of her
own soil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>

<p>It is possible for an American woman
to have no quarrel with any one, no
knowledge of what Europe is quarrelling
about, and no human concern as to which
nations win. But she should not think,
and she certainly should not say, that
the women of the warring lands are
equally ignorant, and equally unconcerned.
To the Serbian woman the freedom
of Serbia is a precious thing. The
French woman cares with her whole soul
for the preservation of France. The Belgian
woman can hardly be indifferent to
the ultimate fate of Belgium. It is even
possible that the English and German
women are not prepared to clasp one
another’s hands and say, “We are sisters,
and it matters nothing to us whether
England or Germany wins.” The pitfall
of the feminist is the belief that the interests
of men and women can ever be severed;
that what brings suffering to the
one can leave the other unscathed.</p>

<p>What are the qualities demanded of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
women in every great national crisis?
First of all, intelligence. They should
have some accurate knowledge of what
has happened, some clear understanding
of the events they so glibly discuss.
There are documents in plenty to enlighten
them. Those tense summer
months in which the war was nursed in
secrecy, are now no longer secret. We
know where the bantling was cradled,
we know what ambitions speeded it on
its evil way, and we have watched every
step of its progress. To condemn all Europe
in terms of easy reprobation, to
clamour for peace without recognition
of justice, is but inconsequent chatter.
It leaves vital issues untouched, and
rational minds unmoved. The sternest
words uttered since the beginning of the
war were spoken by the London “Tablet,”
in reprobation of those American
peace-mongers who could not be brought
to understand that the hope of the Englishwoman’s
heart is that the man whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
she has lost,—husband, son, or brother,—should
not have died in vain.</p>

<p>Next to intelligence, a woman’s most
valuable asset is a reasonable modesty.
She is terribly hampered by a conviction
of her own goodness. It gets in her way
at every step, clouding her naturally
clear perceptions, and clogging her naturally
keen conscientiousness. She is
wrong in assuming with Miss Addams
that she feels a “peculiar moral passion
of revolt against both the cruelty and
the waste of war.” She is wrong in assuming
with Madame Schwimmer that
she “supplants physical courage with
moral courage,” when she calls noisily
for peace. There are men in plenty who
feel the moral passion of revolt quite as
keenly as do the most sensitive of women;
but who also feel the moral responsibility
of defending the safety of their country,
the sacredness of their homes. The
moral courage demanded of every soldier
is fully as great as the physical courage,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
at which women dare to sneer. It
is not a light thing to give up life,—“Greater
love hath no man than this,
that he lay down his life for his friends;”—yet
death is the least of the horrors
which soldiers daily face.</p>

<p>The third and most vital thing asked
of women in these dread days is self-sacrifice.
They must give their share of
help, they must bear their share of sorrow.
They cannot dignify their reluctance
to do this by calling it moral revolt,
or moral courage, or any other high-sounding
name. They cannot claim for
themselves a loftier virtue on the score
of their lower hardihood. Civic morality
consists in putting the good of the state
above the good of the individual. It has
no other test. If women are, as they say,
responsible for the conservation of human
life, they should hold themselves
responsible for the ennobling of human
life, for the cherishing of some finer instinct
than that of self-preservation. On<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
the body of a young French lieutenant
who was killed at Vermelles, there was
found a letter to his wife, which contained
this pregnant sentence: “Promise not to
begrudge me to France, if she takes me
altogether.” These few words are an
epitome of patriotism. Husband and
wife gave to their country all they had
to give; the one his life, the other her
love; and both knew that there is something
better than human life and love.</p>

<p>In the genial reign of Henry the Eighth,
a docile Parliament passed, at the desire
of the King, an “Act to abolish Diversity
of Opinion.” President Wilson, less despotic,
has recommended something of
the same order as a mental process, a
soul-smothering, harmony-preserving,
intellectual anodyne. It is called neutrality,
and if it has failed to save us from
shameful insults and repeated wrongs,
it has kept us fairly quiet under provocation.
The only authorized outlet for our
emotions has been a prayer (conditions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
not mentioned) for peace. Because we
have schooled ourselves to witness injustice—and
occasionally suffer it—without
undue resentment, and without reprisal,
our reward in money has been very
great; and we have kept on terms with
our own souls by giving back to desolate
Europe a little of the wealth we
drew from her. Our position has always
been a tenable one, and no nation has
had any ground on which to censure us;
but we have found in it scant encouragement
for self-esteem. Even the flowers
of domestic oratory, the oft-repeated assertion
that our prudence and our wealth
make us respected on earth, and blessed
in the sight of Heaven, fail to quicken
our sad hearts. For, from over the sea,
comes a cry which sounds like the echo of
words with which we were once familiar,
of which we were once proud. “With
firmness in the right, as God gives us to
see the right, let us strive on to finish the
work we are in.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p>This is the potent voice of humanity,
never to be silenced while men stay men.
The “work” was bloody work; brother
slaying brother on the battlefield. The
women of the North and the women of
the South bore their share of sorrow.
They did not assert that they were victims
of men’s unbridled ambition, and
they never intimated to one another that
the final victory was to them a matter
of unconcern. Theirs was the “solemn
pride” of sacrifice; and that fine phrase,
dedicated by Mr. Lincoln to the woman
who had sent five sons to the conflict, is
applicable to thousands of mothers to-day.
The writer knows a young Frenchman
who, when the war broke out, had
lived for some years in this country, and
hoped to make it his permanent home.
To him his mother wrote: “My son, your
two brothers are at the front. Are you
not coming back to fight for France?”
The lad had not meant to go. Perhaps
he coveted safety. Perhaps he held life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
(his life) to be a sacred thing. Perhaps
he thought to comfort his mother’s old
age. But when that letter came, he sailed
on the next steamer. It was a summons
that few men, and certainly no Frenchman,
could deny.</p>

<p>When the women of France refused to
participate in the International Congress
of Women at The Hague, they defined
their position in a document so dignified,
so lucid, and so logical, that it deserves to
be handed down to future ages as an illustration
of inspired common sense lifted to
the heights of heroism. Let no one who
reads it ever deny that women are capable
of clear thinking, of sane and balanced
judgment. In contrast to the vague and
formless peace-talk which came floating
over to us from Holland, and has been re-echoed
ever since; talk which starting
from no definite premises has reached no
just conclusions, the clear utterances of
these French women rang with insistent
exactitude. They rejected all sentimental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
abstractions, and presented in a concrete
form the circumstances which had pushed
France into the conflict, and which held
her still at bay. “It were treason to think
of peace, until that peace can consecrate
the principles of right.”</p>

<p>The rationality of the French mind,
the essentially practical nature of the
French genius, are responsible for the
form of this historic document; but back
of the form lies the spirit, and the spirit
is one of sustained self-sacrifice. “To-day
it is with pride we wear our weeds; it is
with gratitude that we perpetuate the
memory of our dead.” At a time when
every franc could buy some sorely needed
supply, when every hour could be filled
with some sorely needed service, sensible
Frenchwomen refused to spend both
money and time in journeying to The
Hague for the dear delights of talking.
But deeper than their reluctance to do a
wasteful thing was their reluctance to do
a treasonable thing, to put the comforts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
of peace above the sacrifices entailed by
war, to refuse by word or deed their share
of a common burden.</p>

<p>It is absurd to suppose that these brave
and suffering women do not feel a moral
revolt against the cruelty and the waste
of war quite as sharply as does Miss
Addams, or any Hague delegate, or any
one of Mr. Ford’s tourists. The “basic
foundation of home and of peaceful industry”
is as dear to them as to the American
women who talk so much about it.
As a matter of fact, it is their devotion
which holds together the shattered homes
of France, their industry which preserves
economic safety, and gives food and shelter
to the destitute. And through terrible
months of pain and privation, we have
heard from the lips of Frenchwomen no
wild and weak complaints. Never once
have they assumed that they were better
and nobler than their husbands and sons
who died for the needs of France.</p>

<p>When the late Justice Brewer said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
that “since the beginning of days”
women have been opposed to blood-shed,
we wondered—without doubting
the truth of his assertion—how he came
to find it out. Certainly not from the
pages of history, which afford little or
no evidence on the subject. This may
be one reason why feminists are protesting
stoutly against the way in which
history has been written, its indiscreet
revelations, its disconcerting silences.
At a meeting of the Women’s Political
Union in New York, October, 1914, it
was boldly urged that history should be
re-written on a peace basis; less emphasis
placed upon nationalism, less
space devoted to wars. At a meeting of
the National Municipal League in Baltimore
the same year, it was urged that
history should be re-written on a feminine
basis; less emphasis placed upon
men, less space devoted to their achievements.
One revolutionist complained
with exceeding bitterness that President<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
Wilson hardly makes mention of women
in his five volumes of American history.
The “knell” of that kind of narrative,
she intimated, had “rung.”</p>

<p>The historian of the future will find
his task pleasantly simplified. He will be
a little like two young Americans whom I
once met scampering blithely over southern
Europe, and to whom I ventured
to say that they covered their ground
quickly. “No trouble about that,” answered
one of them. “We draw the line
at churches and galleries, and there’s
nothing left to see.” So, too, the chronicler
who eliminates men and war from his
pages can move swiftly down the centuries.
Even an earnest effort to minimize
these factors suggests that blight of my
girlhood, Miss Strickland, who forever
strove to withdraw her wandering attention
from warrior and statesman, and
fix it on the trousseau of a queen.</p>

<p>History is, and has always been trammelled
by facts. It may ignore some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
and deny others; but it cannot accommodate
itself unreservedly to theories;
it cannot be stripped of things evidenced
in favour of things surmised. Perhaps
instead of asking to have it remodelled
in our behalf, we women might take the
trouble to read it as it is; dominated by
men, disfigured by conflict, but not altogether
ignoble or unprofitable, and
always very enlightening. We might
learn from it, for example, that war may
be wicked, and war may be justifiable;
that wife and child, far from being unconsidered
trifles, have nerved men’s
arms to strike; and that when home,
country, freedom and justice are at
stake, “it were treason to think of peace,
until that peace can consecrate the principles
of right.”</p>

</div>


<p>There is nothing new about the
Seven Deadly Sins. They are as
old as humanity. There is nothing
mysterious about them. They are
easier to understand than the Cardinal
Virtues. Nor have they dwelt apart in
secret places; but, on the contrary, have
presented themselves, undisguised and
unabashed, in every corner of the world,
and in every epoch of recorded history.
Why then do so many men and women
talk and write as if they had just discovered
these ancient associates of mankind?
Why do they press upon our
reluctant notice the result of their researches?
Why this fresh enthusiasm in
dealing with a foul subject? Why this relentless
determination to make us intimately
acquainted with matters of which
a casual knowledge would suffice?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p>Above all, why should our self-appointed
instructors assume that because
we do not chatter about a thing, we
have never heard of it? The well-ordered
mind knows the value, no less than the
charm, of reticence. The fruit of the tree
of knowledge, which is now recommended
as nourishing for childhood,
strengthening for youth, and highly restorative
for old age, falls ripe from its
stem; but those who have eaten with
sobriety find no need to discuss the processes
of digestion. Human experience
is very, very old. It is our surest monitor,
our safest guide. To ignore it crudely
is the error of those ardent but uninstructed
missionaries who have lightly
undertaken the re-building of the social
world.</p>

<p>Therefore it is that the public is being
daily instructed concerning matters
which it was once assumed to know,
and which, as a matter of fact, it has always
known. When “The Lure” was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
played three years ago at the Maxine
Elliott Theatre in New York, the redoubtable
Mrs. Pankhurst arose in Mrs.
Belmont’s box, and, unsolicited, informed
the audience that it was the truth which
was being nakedly presented to them,
and that as truth it should be taken to
heart. Now, it is probable that the audience—adult
men and women—knew
as much about the situations developed
in “The Lure” as did Mrs. Pankhurst. It
is possible that some of them knew more,
and could have given her points. But
whatever may be the standard of morality,
the standard of taste (and taste is a
guardian of morality) must be curiously
lowered, when a woman spectator at an
indecent play commends its indecencies
to the careful consideration of the audience.
Even the absurdity of the proceeding
fails to win pardon for its grossness.</p>

<p>It is not so much the nature of the
advice showered upon us to which we
reasonably object, but the fact that a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
great deal of it is given in the wrong
way, at the wrong time, by the wrong
people. Who made Mrs. Pankhurst our
nursery governess, and put us in <i>her</i>
hands for schooling? We might safely
laugh at and ignore these unsolicited
exhortations, were it not that the crude
detailing of matters offensive to modesty
is as hurtful to the young as it is wearisome
to the old. Does it never occur to
the women, who are now engaged in
telling the world what the world has
known since the days of Nineveh, that
more legitimate, and, on the whole, more
enlightened avenues exist for the distribution
of such knowledge?</p>

<p>The “Conspiracy of Silence” is broken.
Of that no one can doubt. The phrase
may be suffered to lapse into oblivion.
In its day it was a menace, and few of
us would now advocate the deliberate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
ignoring of things not to be denied. Few
of us would care to see the rising generation
as uninstructed in natural laws
as we were, as adrift amid the unintelligible,
or partly intelligible things of life.
But surely the breaking of silence need
not imply the opening of the floodgates
of speech. It was never meant by those
who first cautiously advised a clearer understanding
of sexual relations and hygienic
laws that everybody should chatter
freely respecting these grave issues;
that teachers, lecturers, novelists, story-writers,
militants, dramatists, and social
workers should copiously impart all they
know, or assume they know, to the world.
The lack of restraint, the lack of balance,
the lack of soberness and common sense
were never more apparent than in the
obsession of sex, which has set us all
a-babbling about matters once excluded
from the amenities of conversation.</p>

<p>Knowledge is the cry. Crude, undigested
knowledge, without limit and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
without reserve. Give it to boys, give
it to girls, give it to children. No other
force is taken into account by the visionaries
who—in defiance, or in ignorance,
of history—believe that evil understood
is evil conquered. “The menace of degradation
and destruction can be checked
<i>only</i> by the dissemination of knowledge
on the subject of sex-physiology and
hygiene,” writes an enthusiast in the
“Forum,” calling our attention to the
methods which have been employed by
some public schools, noticeably the Polytechnic
High School of Los Angeles, for
the instruction of students; and urging
that similar lectures be given to boys
and girls in the grammar schools. It is
noticeable that while a woman doctor
was employed to lecture to the girl students
of the Polytechnic, a “science
man” was chosen by preference for the
boys. Doctors are proverbially reticent,—except,
indeed, on the stage, where
they prattle of all they know; but a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
“science man”—as distinct from a man
of science—may be trusted, if he be
young and ardent, to conceal little or
nothing from his hearers. The lectures
were obligatory for the boys, but optional
for the girls, whose inquisitiveness
could be relied upon. “The universal
eagerness of under-classmen to reach the
serene upper heights” (I quote the language
of the “Forum”) “gave the
younger girls increased interest in the
advanced lectures, if, indeed, a girl’s
natural curiosity regarding these vital
facts needs any stimulus.”</p>

<p>Perhaps it does not, but I am disposed
to think it receives a strong artificial
stimulus from instructors whose minds
are unduly engrossed with sexual problems,
and that this artificial stimulus is
a menace rather than a safeguard. We
hear too much about the thirst for knowledge
from people keen to quench it. Dr.
Edward L. Keyes advocates the teaching
of sex-hygiene to children, because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
he thinks it is the kind of information
that children are eagerly seeking. “What
is this topic,” he asks, “that all these
little ones are questioning over, mulling
over, fidgeting over, imagining over,
worrying over? Ask your own memories.”</p>

<p>I do ask my memory in vain for the
answer Dr. Keyes anticipates. A child’s
life is so full, and everything that enters
it seems of supreme importance. I fidgeted
over my hair, which would not
curl. I worried over my examples, which
never came out right. I mulled (though
unacquainted with the word) over every
piece of sewing put into my incapable
fingers, which could not be trained to
hold a needle. I imagined I was stolen
by brigands, and became—by virtue of
beauty and intelligence—spouse of a
patriotic outlaw in a frontierless land. I
asked artless questions which brought
me into discredit with my teachers, as,
for example, who “massacred” St. Bartholomew.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
But vital facts, the great laws
of propagation, were matters of but
casual concern, crowded out of my life,
and out of my companions’ lives (in a
convent boarding-school) by the more
stirring happenings of every day. How
could we fidget over obstetrics when we
were learning to skate, and our very
dreams were a medley of ice and bumps?
How could we worry over “natural
laws” in the face of a tyrannical interdict
which lessened our chances of breaking
our necks by forbidding us to coast
down a hill covered with trees? The
children to be pitied, the children whose
minds become infected with unwholesome
curiosity, are those who lack cheerful
recreation, religious teaching, and the
fine corrective of work. A playground
or a swimming-pool will do more to keep
them mentally and morally sound than
scores of lectures upon sex-hygiene.</p>

<p>The point of view of the older generation
was not altogether the futile thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
it seems to the progressive of to-day. It
assumed that children brought up in
honour and goodness, children disciplined
into some measure of self-restraint,
and taught very plainly the difference between
right and wrong in matters childish
and seasonable, were in no supreme
danger from the gradual and somewhat
haphazard expansion of knowledge. It
unconsciously reversed the adage, “Forewarned,
forearmed,” into “Forearmed,
forewarned”; paying more heed to the
arming than to the warning. It held that
the workingman was able to rear his
children in decency. The word degradation
was not so frequently coupled with
poverty as it is now. Nor was it anybody’s
business in those simple days to
impress upon the poor the wretchedness
of their estate.</p>

<p>If knowledge alone could save us from
sin, the salvation of the world would be
easy work. If by demonstrating the injuriousness
of evil, we could insure the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
acceptance of good, a little logic would
redeem mankind. But the laying of the
foundation of law and order in the mind,
the building up of character which will
be strong enough to reject both folly and
vice,—this is no facile task.</p>

<p>The justifiable reliance placed by our
fathers upon religion and discipline has
given place to a reliance upon understanding.
It is assumed that youth will
abstain from wrong-doing, if only the
physical consequences of wrong-doing
are made sufficiently clear. There are
those who believe that a regard for future
generations is a powerful deterrent
from immorality, that boys and girls
can be so interested in the quality of the
baby to be born in 1990 that they will
master their wayward impulses for its
sake. What does not seem to occur to
us is that this deep sense of obligation to
ourselves and to our fellow creatures is
the fruit of self-control. A course of lectures
will not instil self-control into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
human heart. It is born of childish virtues
acquired in childhood, youthful virtues
acquired in youth, and a wholesome
preoccupation with the activities of life
which gives young people something to
think about besides the sexual relations
which are pressed so relentlessly upon
their attention.</p>

<p>The world is wide, and a great deal is
happening in it. I do not plead for ignorance,
but for the gradual and harmonious
broadening of the field of knowledge,
and for a more careful consideration of
ways and means. There are subjects
which may be taught in class, and subjects
which commend themselves to individual
teaching. There are topics which
admit of <i>plein-air</i> handling, and topics
which civilized man, as apart from his
artless brother of the jungles, has veiled
with reticence. There are truths which
may be, and should be, privately imparted
by a father, a mother, a family
doctor, or an experienced teacher; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
which young people cannot advantageously
acquire from the platform, the
stage, the moving-picture gallery, the
novel, or the ubiquitous monthly magazine.</p>

<p>Yet all these sources of information
are competing with one another as to
which shall tell us most. All of them
have missions, and all the missions are
alike. We are gravely assured that the
drama has awakened to a high and holy
duty, that it has a “serious call,” in obedience
to which it has turned the stage
into a clinic for the diagnosing of disease,
and into a self-authorized commission
for the intimate study of vice. It
advertises itself as “battling with the
evils of the age,”—which are the evils
of every age,—and its method of warfare
is to exploit the sins of the sensual
for the edification of the virtuous, to
rake up the dunghills with the avowed
purpose of finding a jewel. The doors of
the brothel have been flung hospitably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
open, and we have been invited to peep
and peer (always in the interests of morality)
into regions which were formerly
closed to the uninitiated. It has been discovered
that situations, once the exclusive
property of the police courts, make valuable
third acts, or can be usefully employed
in curtain-lifters, unclean and undramatic,
but which claim to “tell their
story so clearly that the daring is lost in
the splendid moral lesson conveyed.”
Familiarity with vice (which an old-fashioned
but not inexperienced moralist
like Pope held to be a perilous thing) is
advocated as a safeguard, especially for
the young and ardent. The lowering of
our standard of taste, the deadening of
our finer sensibilities, are matters of no
moment to dramatist or to manager.
They have other interests at stake.</p>

<p>For depravity is a valuable asset when
presented to the consideration of the undepraved.
It has coined money for the
proprietors of moving-pictures, who for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
the past few years have been sending
shows with attractive titles about “White
Slaves,” and “Outcasts,” and “Traffic in
Souls,” all over the country. Many of
these shows claimed to be dramatizations
of the reports of vice-commissioners, who
have thus entered the arena of sport, and
become purveyors of pleasure to the multitude.
“Original,” “Authentic,” “Authorized,”
are words used freely in their
advertisements. The public is assured
that “care has been taken to eliminate
all suggestiveness,” which is in a measure
true. When everything is told, there is
no room left for suggestions. If you kick
a man down stairs and out of the door,
you may candidly say that you never
suggested he should leave your house.
Now and then a particularly lurid revelation
is commended to us as having
received the endorsement of leading
feminists; and again we are driven to
ask why should these ladies assume an
intimate knowledge of such alien matters?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
Why should they play the part of
mentors to such an experienced Telemachus
as the public?</p>

<p>It is hard to estimate the harm done
by this persistent and crude handling of
sexual vice. The peculiar childishness
inherent in all moving-picture shows
may possibly lessen their hurtfulness.
What if the millionaires and the political
bosses so depicted spend their existence
in entrapping innocent young women?
A single policeman of tender years, a
single girl, inexperienced but resourceful,
can defeat these fell conspirators, and
bring them all to justice. Never were
villains so helpless in a hard and virtuous
world. But silliness is no sure safeguard,
and to excite in youth a curiosity
concerning brothels and their inmates
can hardly fail of mischief. To demonstrate
graphically and publicly the value
of girls in such places is to familiarize
them dangerously with sin. I can but
hope that the little children who sit stolidly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
by their mothers’ sides, and whom
the authorities of every town should exclude
from all shows dealing with prostitution,
are saved from defilement by the
invincible ignorance of childhood. As for
the groups of boys and young men who
compose the larger part of the audiences,
and who snigger and whisper whenever
the situations grow intense, nobody in
his senses could assert that the pictures
convey a “moral lesson” to them.</p>

<p>Nor is it for the conveying of lessons
that managers present these photo-plays
to the public. They are out to make
money, and they are making it. Granted
that when M. Brieux wrote “Les Avariés,”
he purposed a stern warning to the
pleasure-loving world. No one can read
the simple and sober words with which
he prefaced the work, and doubt his absolute
sincerity. Granted, though with
some misgivings, that the presentation
of “Damaged Goods” in this country—albeit
commercialized and a smart business<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
venture—had still a moral and scientific
significance. It was not primarily
designed as an exploitation of vice. But
to tell such a story in moving pictures is
to rob it of all excuse for being told at
all. To thrust such a theme grossly and
vulgarly before the general public, stripping
it of nobility of thought and exactitude
of speech, and leaving only the dull
dregs of indecency, is an uncondonable
offense,—the deeper because it claims to
be beneficent.</p>

<p>In one respect all the studies of seduction
now presented so urgently to our
regard are curiously alike. They all conspire
to lift the burden of blame from the
woman’s shoulders, to free her from any
sense of human responsibility. It is assumed
that she plays no part in her own
undoing, that she is as passive as the
animal bought for vivisection, as mute
and helpless in the tormentors’ hands.
The tissue of false sentiment woven
about her has resulted in an extraordinary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
confusion of outlook, a perilous
nullification of honesty and honour.</p>

<p>To illustrate this point, I quote some
verses which appeared in a periodical
devoted to social work, a periodical with
high and serious aims. I quote them reluctantly
(not deeming them fit for publication),
and only because it is impossible
to ignore the fact that their appearance
in such a paper makes them doubly and
trebly reprehensible. They are entitled
“The Cry to Christ of the Daughters of
Shame.”</p>

<p>Now apart from the offence against
religion in this easy comparison between
the Saviour and the woman of the
streets, and apart from the deplorable
offence against good taste, which might
repel even the irreligious, such unqualified
acquittal stands forever in the way
of reform, of the judgment and common
sense which make for the betterment of
the world. How is it possible to awaken
any healthy emotion in the hearts of sinners
so smothered in sentimentality?
How is it possible to make girls and
young women (as yet respectable) understand
not only the possibility, but the
obligation of a decent life?</p>

<p>There would be less discussion of meretricious
subjects, either in print or in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
conversation, were it not for the morbid
sensibility which has undermined our
judgment, and set our nerves a-quivering.
Even a counsellor so sane and so experienced
as the Reverend Honourable
Edward Lyttelton, Headmaster of Eton,
who has written an admirable volume
on “Training of the Young in Laws of
Sex,” drops his tone of wholesome austerity
as soon as he turns from the safeguarding
of lads to the pensive consideration
of women. Boys and men he
esteems to be captains of their souls, but
the woman is adrift on the sea of life.
He does not urge her to restraint; he
pleads for her to the masters of her fate.
“The unhappy partners of a rich man’s
lust,” he writes, “are beings born with
the mighty power to love, and are endowed
with deep and tender instincts of
loyalty and motherhood. When these
divine and lovely graces of character are
utterly shattered and foully degraded,
the man, on whom all the treasure has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
been lavished, tries to believe that he has
made ample reparation by an annuity of
fifty pounds.”</p>

<p>This kind of sentiment is out of place
in everything save eighteenth-century
lyrics, which are not expected to be a
guiding force in morals. A woman with
“lovely graces of character” does not
usually become the mistress even of a
rich man. After all, there is such a thing
as triumphant virtue. It has an established
place in the annals and traditions,
the ballads and stories of every land.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">

    <div class="verse indent0">The wench of a monarcke,” quoth Mary Ambree.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is like a breath of fresh air blowing
away mists to hear this gay and gallant
militant assert the possibilities of resistance.</p>

<p>Forty years ago, a writer in “Blackwood’s
Magazine” commented upon the
amazing fact that in Hogarth’s day (more
than a century earlier) vignettes representing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
the “Rake’s Progress,” and the
“Harlot’s Progress,” were painted upon
fans carried by young women. “English
girls,” said this sober essayist, “were
thus, by way of warning, made familiar
with subjects now wisely withheld from
their consideration.”</p>

<p>The pendulum has swung backward
since 1876. Even Hogarth, who dealt
for the most part with the robust simplicities
of sin, would have little to teach
the rising generation of 1916. Its sources
of knowledge are manifold, and astoundingly
explicit. Stories minutely describing
houses of ill-fame, their furniture,
their food, their barred windows, their
perfumed air, and the men with melancholy
eyes who visit them. Novels purporting
to be candid and valuable studies
of degeneracy and nymphomania. Plays
and protests urging stock-farm methods
of breeding the human race. Papers on
venereal diseases scattered broadcast
through the land. Comment upon those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
unnatural vices which have preceded
the ruin of cities and the downfall of
nations, and veiled allusions to which
have marked the deepest degradation
of the French stage. All these horrors,
which would have made honest old
Hogarth turn uneasily in his grave, are
offered for the defence of youth and the
purifying of civilized society.</p>

<p>The lamentable lack of reserve is closely
associated with a lamentable absence of
humour. We should be saved from many
evils, if we could laugh at more absurdities.
We could clearly estimate the value
of reform, if we were not so befuddled
with the sensationalism of reformers, and
so daunted by the amazing irregularity
of their methods. What can be thought
of a woman who goes to a household of
strangers, and volunteers to instruct its
members in sex-hygiene! In the case
which came under my notice, the visitor
chanced upon a family of spinsters,
discreet, retiring, well-conducted gentlewomen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
the eldest of whom was eighty,
and the youngest sixty years of age.
But while this circumstance added to the
humour of the situation, it in no wise
lessened its insolent impropriety.</p>

<p>The enthusiasm for birth-control has
carried its advocates so fast and so far
from the conventions of society that two
of them have been arrested in the State
of New York for circulating indecent
matter through the mails, and one has
been convicted on this charge. To run
amuck through the formalities of civilization,
and then proclaim yourself a martyr
to science and the public good, is one
way of acquiring notoriety. To invite
the selfish and the cowardly to follow the
line of least resistance is one way, and a
very easy way, of ensuring popularity.
Thirty years ago, Mr. Robert Louis Stevenson
wrote the story of a Spanish girl,
born of a decadent and perishing race,
to whom comes the promise of love, and
of escape from her dire surroundings.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
Both these boons she rejects, knowing
that the line from which she springs is fit
for nothing but extinction, and knowing
also that lesson hard to learn,—“that
pain is the choice of the magnanimous,
that it is better to suffer all things, and do
well.” Twenty years ago, Miss Elizabeth
Robins gave us her solution of a similar
problem. The heroine of her novel, fully
aware that she comes of a stock diseased
in mind and body, and that her lover,
who is near of kin, shares this inheritance,
forces upon him (he is a quiescent gentleman,
more than willing to be let alone)
first marriage, and then suicide. We must
have our hour of happiness, is her initial
demand. We must pay the price, is her
ultimate decision. In our day, the noble
austerity commended by Mr. Stevenson,
the passionate wilfulness condoned by
Miss Robins, are equally out of date.
The International Neo-Malthusian Bureau
has easier methods to propose, and
softer ways to sanction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span></p>

<p>It is touching to hear Mr. Percy MacKaye
lament that “Mendelism has as yet
hardly begun to influence art or popular
feeling”; but he must not lose hope,—not,
at least, so far as popular feeling is
concerned. “Practical eugenics” is a
phrase as familiar in our ears as “intensive
farming.” “How can we make the
desirable marry one another?” asks Dr.
Alexander Graham Bell, and answers his
own question by affirming that every
community should take a hand in the
matter, giving the “support of public
opinion,” and the more emphatic support
of “important and well-paid positions”
to a choice stock of men, provided always
that, “in the interests of the race,”
they marry and have offspring.</p>

<p>This is practical eugenics with a vengeance,
but it is not practical business.
Apart from the fact that most men and
women regard marriage as a personal
matter, with which their neighbours have
no concern, it does not follow that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
admirable and athletic young husband
possesses any peculiar ability. Little runts
of men are sometimes the ablest of citizens.
When Nature is in a jesting mood,
her best friends marvel at her blunders.</p>

<p>The connection between Mendelism
and art is still a trifle strained. It is an
alliance which Mendel himself—good
abbot of Brünn working patiently in his
cloister garden—failed to take into account.
The field of economics is not Art’s
chosen playground; the imparting of
scientific truths has never been her mission.
Whether she deals with high and
poignant emotions, or with the fears and
wreckage of life, she subdues these human
elements into an austere accord with
her own harmonious laws. She is as remote
from the crudities of the honest but
uninspired reformer who dabbles in fiction
and the drama, as she is remote
from the shameless camp-followers of reform,
for whose base ends, no less than
for our instruction and betterment, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
Seven Deadly Sins have acquired their
present regrettable popularity. Liberated
from the unsympathetic atmosphere of
the catechism, they are urged upon the
weary attention of adults, embodied in
the lessons of youth, and explained in
words of one syllable to childhood. Yet
Hogarth never designed his pictures to
decorate the fans of women. Suetonius
never related his “pleasant atrocities”
to the boys and girls of Rome.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Popular_Education">Popular Education</h2>
</div>


<p>This is so emphatically the children’s
age that a good many of
us are beginning to thank God
we were not born in it. The little girl
who said she wished she had lived in the
time of Charles the Second, because then
“education was much neglected,” wins
our sympathy and esteem. It is a doubtful
privilege to have the attention of the
civilized world focussed upon us both
before and after birth. At the First International
Eugenics Congress, held in London
in the summer of 1912, an Italian
delegate made the somewhat discouraging
statement that the children of very
young parents are more prone than others
to theft; that the children of middle-aged
parents are apt to be of good conduct,
but of low intelligence; and that the
children of elderly parents are, as a rule,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
intelligent, but badly behaved. It seems
to be a trifle hard to bring the right kind
of a child into the world. Twenty-seven
is, in this eugenist’s opinion, the best age
for parentage; but how bend all the complicated
conditions of life to meet an arbitrary
date; and how remain twenty-seven
long enough to insure satisfactory
results? The vast majority of babies will
have to put up with being born when
their time comes, and make the best of
it. This is the first, but by no means the
worst, disadvantage of compulsory birth;
and compulsory birth is the original evil
which scientists and philanthropists are
equally powerless to avert.</p>

<p>If parents do not know by this time
how to bring up their children, it is not
for lack of instruction. A few generations
ago, Solomon was the only writer on
child-study who enjoyed any vogue.
Now his precepts, the acrid fruits of experience,
have been superseded by more
genial, but more importunate counsel.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
Begirt by well-wishers, hemmed in on
every side by experts who speak of
“child-material” as if it were raw silk or
wood-pulp, how can a little boy, born in
this enlightened age, dodge the educational
influences which surround him?
It is hard to be dealt with as “child-material,”
when one is only an ordinary
little boy. To be sure, “child-material”
is never thrashed, as little boys were
wont to be, it is not required to do what
it is told, it enjoys rights and privileges
of a very sacred and exalted character;
but, on the other hand, it is never let
alone, and to be let alone is sometimes
worth all the ministrations of men and
angels. The helpless, inarticulate reticence
of a child is not an obstacle to be
overcome, but a barrier which protects
the citadel of childhood from assault.</p>

<p>We can break down this barrier in
our zeal; and if the child will not speak,
we can at least compel him to listen.
He is powerless to evade any revelations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
we choose to make, any facts or theories
we choose to elucidate. We can teach him
sex-hygiene when he is still young enough
to believe that rabbits lay eggs. We can
turn his work into play, and his play into
work, keeping well in mind the educational
value of his unconscious activities,
and, by careful oversight, pervert a game
of tag into a preparation for the business
of life. We can amuse and interest him
until he is powerless to amuse and interest
himself. We can experiment with him
according to the dictates of hundreds of
rival authorities. He is in a measure at
our mercy, though nature fights hard
for him, safeguarding him with ignorance
of our mode of thought, and indifference
to our point of view. The opinions of
twelve-year-old Bobby Smith are of more
moment to ten-year-old Tommy Jones
than are the opinions of Dr. and Mrs.
Jones, albeit Dr. Jones is a professor of
psychology, and Mrs. Jones the president
of a Parents’ League. The supreme<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
value of Mr. Robert Louis Stevenson’s
much-quoted “Lantern Bearers” lies in
its incisive and sympathetic insistence
upon the aloofness of the child’s world,—an
admittedly imperfect world which we
are burning to amend, but which closed
its doors upon us forever when we grew
into knowledge and reason.</p>

<p>My own childhood lies very far away.
It occurred in what I cannot help thinking
a blissful period of intermission. The
educational theories of the Edgeworths
(evolved soberly from the educational
excesses of Rousseau) had been found a
trifle onerous. Parents had not the time
to instruct and admonish their children
all day long. As a consequence, we enjoyed
a little wholesome neglect, and
made the most of it. The new era of
child-study and mothers’ congresses lay
darkling in the future. “Symbolic education,”
“symbolic play,” were phrases
all unknown. The “revolutionary discoveries”
of Karl Groos had not yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
overshadowed the innocent diversions
of infancy. Nobody drew scientific deductions
from jackstones, or balls, or
gracehoops, save only when we assailed
the wealth of nations by breaking a window-pane.
Nobody was even aware that
the impulses which sent us speeding and
kicking up our heels like young colts
were “vestigial organs of the soul.” Dr.
G. Stanley Hall had not yet invented this
happy phrase to elucidate the simplicities
of play. How we grasped our “objective
relationship” to our mothers
without the help of bird’s-nest games, I
do not know. Perhaps, in the general
absence of experimentation, we had more
time in which to solve the artless problems
of our lives. Psychologists in those
days were frankly indifferent to us. They
had yet to discover our enormous value
in the realms of conjectural thought.</p>

<p>The education of my childhood was
embryonic. The education of to-day is
exhaustive. The fact that the school-child<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
of to-day does not seem to know any
more than we knew in the dark ages, is
a side issue with which I have no concern.
But as I look back, I can now see
plainly that the few things little girls
learned were admirably adapted for one
purpose,—to make us parts of a whole,
which whole was the family. I do not
mean that there was any expression to
this effect. “Training for maternity”
was not a phrase in vogue; and the short
views of life, more common then than
now, would have robbed it of its savour.
“Training for citizenship” had, so far as
we were concerned, no meaning whatsoever.
A little girl was a little girl, not
the future mother of the race, or the future
saviour of the Republic. One thing
at a time. Therefore no deep significance
was attached to our possession of a doll,
no concern was evinced over our future
handling of a vote. If we were taught to
read aloud with correctness and expression,
to write notes with propriety and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
grace, and to play backgammon and
whist as well as our intelligence permitted,
it was in order that we should
practise these admirable accomplishments
for the benefit of the families of
which we were useful, and occasionally
ornamental features.</p>

<p>And what advantage accrued to <i>us</i>
from an education so narrowed, so illiberal,
so manifestly unconcerned with
great social and national issues? Well,
let us admit that it had at least the qualities
of its defects. It was not called training
for character, but it was admittedly
training for behaviour, and the foundations
of character are the acquired habits
of youth. “Habit,” said the Duke of
Wellington, “is ten times nature.” There
was precision in the simple belief that
the child was strengthened mentally by
mastering its lessons, and morally by
mastering its inclinations. Therefore the
old-time teacher sought to spur the pupil
on to keen and combative effort, rather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
than to beguile him into knowledge
with cunning games and lantern slides.
Therefore the old-time parent set a high
value on self-discipline and self-control.
A happy childhood did not necessarily
mean a childhood free from proudly
accepted responsibility. There are few
things in life so dear to girl or boy as
the chance to turn to good account the
splendid self-confidence of youth.</p>

<p>If Saint Augustine, who was punished
when he was a little lad because he loved
to play, could see how childish pastimes
are dignified in the pedagogy of the
twentieth century, he would no longer
say that “playing is the business of childhood.”
He would know that it is the supremely
important business, the crushing
responsibility of the pedagogue. Nothing
is too profound, nothing too subtle
to be evolved from a game or a toy. We
are gravely told that “the doll with its
immense educational power should be
carefully introduced into the schools,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
that “Pussy-in-the-Corner” is “an Ariadne
clew to the labyrinth of experience,”
and that a ball, tossed to the accompaniment
of a song insultingly banal, will
enable a child “to hold fast one high
purpose amid all the vicissitudes of time
and place.” If we would only make organized
play a part of the school curriculum,
we should have no need of camps,
or drills, or military training. It is the
moulder of men, the upholder of nations,
the character-builder of the world.</p>

<p>Mr. Joseph Lee, who has written a
book of five hundred pages on “Play in
Education,” and Mr. Henry S. Curtis,
who has written a book of three hundred
and fifty pages on “Education through
Play,” have treated their theme with profound
and serious enthusiasm, which, in
its turn, is surpassed by the fervid exaltation
of their reviewers. These counsellors
have so much that is good to urge
upon us, and we are so ready to listen
to their words, that they could have well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
afforded to be more convincingly moderate.
There is no real use in saying that
it is play which makes the world go
round, because we know it isn’t. If it
were, the world of the savage would go
round as efficaciously as the world of the
civilized man. When Mr. Lee tells us that
the little boy who plays baseball “follows
the ball each day further into the unexplored
regions of potential character,
and comes back each evening a larger
moral being than he set forth,” we merely
catch our breath, and read on. We have
known so many boys, and we are disillusioned.
When Mr. Curtis points out
to us that English school-boys play more
and play better than any other lads, and
that their teachers advocate and encourage
the love of sport because it breeds
“good common sense, and resourcefulness
which will enable them to meet the
difficulties of life,” we ask ourselves doubtfully
whether Englishmen do meet life’s
difficulties with an intelligence so keen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
and adjusted as to prove the potency of
play. The work which is demanded of
French and German school-boys would
seem to English and American school-boys
(to say nothing of English and
American parents) cruel and excessive;
yet Frenchmen and Germans are not
destitute of resourcefulness, and they
meet the difficulties of life with a concentration
of purpose which is the wonder
of the world.</p>

<p>Even the moderate tax which is now
imposed upon the leisure and freedom
of American children has been declared
illegal. It is possible and praiseworthy,
we are assured, to spare them all “unnatural
restrictions,” all uncongenial labour.
There are pastimes in plenty which
will impart to them information, without
demanding any effort on their part.
Folk-songs, and rhythmic dances, and
story-telling, and observation classes, and
“wholesome and helpful games,” fill
up a pleasant morning for little pupils;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
and when they grow bigger, more
stirring sports await them. Listen to
Judge Lindsey’s enthusiastic description
of the school-room of the future, where
moving pictures will take the place of
books and blackboards, where no free
child will be “chained to a desk” (painful
phrase!), and where “progressive
educators” will make merry with their
pupils all the happy day.</p>

<p>“Mr. Edison is coming to the rescue
of Tony,” says Judge Lindsey. (Tony is
a boy who does not like school as it is
at present organized.) “He will take him
away from me, and put him in a school
that is not a school at all, but just one
big game;—just one round of joy, of
play, of gladness, of knowledge, of sunshine,
warming the cells in Tony’s head
until they all open up as the flowers
do. There will be something moving,
something doing at that school all the
time, just as there is when Tony goes
down to the tracks to see the engines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span></p>

<p>“When I tell him about it, Tony
shouts, ‘Hooray for Mr. Edison!’ right
in front of the battery, just as he used to
say, ‘To hell wid de cop.’”</p>

<p>Now this is an interesting exposition
of the purely sentimental view of education.
We have been leading up to it
for years, ever since Froebel uttered his
famous “Come, let us live with our
children!” and here it is set down in
black and white by a man who has the
welfare of the young deeply at heart.
Judge Lindsey sympathizes with Tony’s
distaste for study. He points out to us
that it is hard for a boy who is “the
leader of a gang” to be laughed at by
less enterprising children because he
cannot cipher. Yet to some of us it does
not seem altogether amiss that Tony
should be brought to understand the existence
of other standards than those of
hoodlumism. Ciphering is dull work (so,
at least, I have always found it), and difficult
work too; but it is hardly fair to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
brand it as ignoble. Compared with
stealing rails from a freight-car, which
is Tony’s alternative for school attendance,
it even has a dignity of its own;
and the perception of this fact may be
a salutary, if mortifying lesson. Judge
Lindsey’s picturesque likening of our
antiquated school system which compels
children to sit at desks, with the
antiquated Chinese custom which bound
little girls’ feet, lacks discernment. The
underlying motives are, in these instances,
measurably different, the processes
are dissimilar, the results have
points of variance.</p>

<p>Nobody doubts that all our Tonys,
rich and poor, lawless and law-abiding,
would much prefer a school that is not
a school at all, “but just one big game”;
nobody doubts that a great deal of
desultory information may be acquired
from films. But desultory information is
not, and never can be, a substitute for
education; and habits of play cannot be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
trusted to develop habits of work. Our
efforts to protect the child from doing
what he does not want to do, because he
does not want to do it, are kind, but unintelligent.
Life is not a vapid thing.
“The world,” says Emerson, “is a proud
place, peopled with men of positive quality.”
No pleasure it can give, from the
time we are seven until the time we are
seventy, is comparable to the pleasure
of achievement.</p>

<p>Dr. Münsterberg, observing with dismay
the “pedagogical unrest” which
pervades our communities, expresses a
naïve surprise that so much sound advice,
and so much sound instruction, should
leave the teacher without inspiration or
enthusiasm. “The pile of interesting facts
which the sciences heap up for the teacher’s
use grows larger and larger, but the
teacher seems to stare at it with growing
hopelessness.”</p>

<p>I should think so. A pile of heterogeneous
facts—segments of segments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
of subjects—reduces any sane teacher
to hopelessness, because he, at least, is
well aware that his pupils cannot possibly
absorb or digest a tithe of the material
pressed upon their acceptance. Experience
has taught him something which
his counsellors never learn,—the need
of limit, the “feasibility of performance.”
Hear what one teacher, both sane and
experienced, has to say concerning the
riot of facts and theories, of art and nature,
of science and sentiment, which the
school is expected to reduce into an orderly,
consistent, and practical system of
education.</p>

<p>“It is not enough that the child should
be taught to handle skilfully the tools
of all learning,—reading, writing, and
arithmetic. His sense of form and his
æsthetic nature must be developed by
drawing; his hand must be trained by
manual work; his musical nature must
be awakened by song; he must be
brought into harmony with his external<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
environment by means of nature lessons
and the study of science; his patriotic
impulses must be roused by American
history and by flag-drills; temperance
must be instilled into him by lessons in
physiology, with special reference to the
effects of alcohol on the human system;
his imagination must be cultivated by
the help of Greek and Norse mythology;
he must gain some knowledge of the
great heroes and events of general history;
he must acquire a love for and
an appreciation of the best literature
through the plentiful reading of masterpieces,
while at the same time his mind
should be stocked with choice gems of
prose and verse, which will be a solace
to him throughout his later life.</p>

<p>“It might be well if, by displacing a
little arithmetic or geography, he could
gain some knowledge of the elements of
Latin or of a modern language; in some
manner there must be roused in him a
love for trees, a respect for birds, an antipathy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
to cigarettes, and an ambition
for clean streets; and somewhere, somewhere
in this mad chaos he must learn to
spell! Do you wonder that teachers in
progressive schools confide to us that
they fear their pupils are slightly bewildered?
Do you wonder that pupils do
not gain the habit and the power of concentrated,
consecutive work?”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> <i>The Existing Relations between School and College</i>,
by Wilson Farrand.</p>

</div>

<p>And this irrational, irrelevant medley,
this educational vaudeville, must be absorbed
unconsciously, and without effort,
by children roused to interest by the
sustained enthusiasm of their teachers,
whom may Heaven help! If the programme
is not full enough, it can be
varied by lectures on sex-hygiene, lessons
in woodcraft (with reference to boy
scouts), and pictures illustrating the domestic
habits of the house-fly. These,
with plenty of gymnastics, and a little
barefoot dancing for girls, may bring a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
school measurably near the ideal proposed
by Judge Lindsey,—a place where
“there is something moving, something
doing all the time,” and which finds its
closest counterpart in the rushing of engines
on their tracks.</p>

<p>The theory that school work must appeal
to a child’s fluctuating tastes, must
attract a child’s involuntary attention,
does grievous wrong to the rising generation;
yet it is upheld in high places,
and forms the subject-matter of many
addresses vouchsafed year after year to
long-suffering educators. They should
bring to bear the “energizing force of
interest,” they should magnetize their
pupils into work. Even Dr. Eliot reminds
them with just a hint of reproach that, if
a child is interested, he will not be disorderly;
and this reiterated statement
appears to be the crux of the whole difficult
situation. Let us boldly suppose
that a child is not interested,—and he
may conceivably weary even of films,—is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
it then optional with him to be, or not
to be, disorderly, and what is the effect
of his disorder on other children whose
tastes may differ from his own?</p>

<p>The Right Reverend Mandell Creighton,
who appears to have made more
addresses to the teachers of England than
any other ecclesiastic of his day, repeatedly
warned them that they should not
attempt to teach any subject without first
making clear to children why this subject
should command attention. If they
failed to do so, said the bishop triumphantly,
the children would not attend. He
was of the opinion that little pupils must
not only be rationally convinced that what
they are asked to do is worth their doing,
but that they must enjoy every step of
their progress. A teacher who could not
make a child feel that it is “just as agreeable”
to be in school as at play, had not
begun his, or her, pedagogical career.</p>

<p>This is a hard saying and a false one.
Every normal child prefers play to work,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
and the precise value of work lies in its
call for renunciation. Nor has any knowledge
ever been acquired and retained
without endeavour. What heroic pains
were taken by Montaigne’s father to spare
his little son the harsh tasks of the school-boy!
At what trouble and cost to the
household was the child taught “the
pure Latin tongue” in infancy, “without
bookes, rules, or grammar, without whipping
or whining”! Greek was also imparted
to him in kindly fashion, “by way
of sporte and recreation.” “We did tosse
our declinations and conjugations to and
fro, as they doe, who, by means of a certaine
game at tables, learne both Arithmeticke
and Geometrie.” Assuredly the
elder Montaigne was a man born out
of date. In our happier age he would
have been a great and honoured upholder
of educational novelties, experimenting
with the school-rooms of the world. In the
sixteenth century he was only a country
gentleman, experimenting with his son,—a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
son who bluntly confesses that, of the
Greek thus pleasantly trifled with, he
had “but small understanding,” and that
the Latin which had been his mother
tongue was speedily “corrupted by discontinuance.”</p>

<p>All the boy gained by the most elaborate
system ever devised for the saving
of labour was that he “overskipped” the
lower forms in school. What he lost was
the habit of mastering his “prescript lessons,”
which he seems to have disliked
as heartily as any student of Guienne.
Neither loss nor gain mattered much to
a man of original parts. The principal
result of his father’s scheme was the lingering
of certain Latin words among the
simple folk of Perigord, who, having
painfully acquired these strange terms in
order to rescue their little master from
his schoolbooks, retained and made use
of them all their lives.</p>

<p>An emphatic note of protest against
our well-meant but enfeebling educational<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
methods was struck by Professor
William James in his “Talks to Teachers,”
published in 1899. The phrase
“Economy of Effort,” so dear to the
kindly hearts of Froebel’s followers, had
no meaning for Dr. James. The ingenious
system by which the child’s tasks, as
well as the child’s responsibilities, are
shifted to the shoulders of the teacher,
made no appeal to his incisive intelligence.
He stoutly asserted that effort is
oxygen to the lungs of youth, and that it is
sheer nonsense to suppose that every step
of education can possibly be made interesting.
The child, like the man, must
meet his difficulties, and master them.
There is no lesson worth learning, no
game worth playing, which does not call
for exertion. Rousseau, it will be remembered,
would not permit Émile to know
what rivalry meant. That harassed child
never even ran a race, lest the base spirit
of competition should penetrate his nerveless
little being. But Professor James, deaf<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
to social sentimentalities, averred that
rivalry is the spur of action, and the impelling
force of civilization. “There is a
noble and generous kind of rivalry as
well as a spiteful and greedy kind,” he
wrote truthfully, “and the noble and
generous form is particularly common in
childhood. All games owe the zest which
they bring with them to the fact that they
are rooted in the emulous passion, yet
they are the chief means of training in
fairness and magnanimity.”</p>

<p>I am aware that it is a dangerous thing
to call kindness sentimental; but our feeling
that children have a right to happiness,
and our sincere effort to protect
them from any approach to pain, have
led imperceptibly to the elimination from
their lives of many strength-giving influences.
A recent volume on “Child
Culture” (a phrase every whit as reprehensible
as “child-material”) speaks always
of naughty children as “patients,”
implying that their unfortunate condition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
is involuntary, and must be cured from
without, not from within. The “rights of
children” include the doubtful privilege
of freedom from restraint, and the doubtful
boon of shelter from obligation. It
seems sweet and kind to teach a child
high principles and steadfastness of purpose
by means of symbolic games rather
than by any open exaction. Unconscious
obedience, like indirect taxation, is supposed
to be paid without strain. Our
feverish fear lest we offend against the
helplessness of childhood, our feverish
concern lest it should be denied its full
measure of content, drive us, burdened
as we are with good intentions, past the
border-line of wisdom. If we were</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Less winning soft, less amiably mild,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">we might see more clearly the value of
standards.</p>

<p>Two years ago I had sent me several
numbers of a Los Angeles newspaper.
They contained a spirited and sympathetic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
account of a woman who had been
arrested for stealing a child’s outfit, and
who pleaded in court that she wanted
the garments for her daughter, the little
girl having refused to go to school, because
other children had laughed at her
shabby clothes. The effect of this pathetic
disclosure was instantaneous and overwhelming.
The woman was released, and
kind-hearted people hastened to send
“nicey” frocks by the “wagon-load” to
the ill-used child. A picture of the heroic
mother in a large plumed hat, and another
of little Ellen in curls and hair-ribbons,
occupied prominent places in the
paper. The public mind was set at rest
concerning the quality of the goods donated.
“Ellen is going to school to-day,”
wrote the jubilant reporter. “She is going
to wear a fluffy new dress with lace,
and hair-ribbons to match. And if any
rude boy so far forgets himself as to tear
that wondrous creation, there will be
others at home to replace it. Happy, oh,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
so happy was the little miss, as she
shook her curls over the dainty dress to-day.
And the mother? Well, a faith in
the inherent goodness of mankind has
been rekindled in her bosom.”</p>

<p>Now the interesting thing about this
journalistic eloquence, and the public
sentiment it represented, is that while
shabbiness was admittedly a burden too
heavy for a child to bear, theft carried
with it no shadow of disgrace. Children
might jeer at a little girl in a worn frock,
but a little girl in “lace and hair-ribbons”
was manifestly above reproach.
Her mother’s transgression had covered
her with glory, not with shame. There
seems to be some confusion of standards
in such a verdict, some deviation from
the paths of rectitude and honour. It is
hard for a child to be more poorly
dressed than her companions; but to
convince her that dishonesty is the best
policy and brings its own reward, is but
a dubious kindness. Nor is it impossible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
to so stiffen her moral fibre that her poor
dress may be worn, if not with pride, at
least with sturdy self-control.</p>

<p>On this point I know whereof I speak,
for, when I was a little girl, my convent
school sheltered a number of Southern
children, reduced to poverty by the Civil
War, and educated (though of this no
one was aware) by the boundless charity
of the nuns. These children were
shabby, with a pathetic shabbiness which
fell far below our very moderate requirements.
Their dresses (in my prehistoric
days, school uniforms were worn only on
Thursdays and Sundays) were strangely
antiquated, as though cut down from the
garments of mothers and grandmothers,
their shoes were scuffed, their hats were
hopeless. But the unquenchable pride
with which they bore themselves invested
such hardships with distinction. Their
poverty was the honourable outcome of
war; and this fact, added to their simple
and sincere conviction that a girl born<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
below the Mason and Dixon line must
necessarily be better than a girl born
above it, carried them unscathed through
the valley of humiliation. Looking back
now with an unbiassed mind, I am disposed
to consider their claim to superiority
unfounded; but, at the time, their
single-mindedness carried conviction.
The standards they imposed were preeminently
false, but they were less ignoble
than the standards imposed by wealth.
No little American boy or girl can know
to-day what it means to have the character
set in childhood by history, by the
vividness of early years lived under
strange and violent conditions, by the
sufferings, the triumphs, the high and sad
emotions of war.</p>

<p>There is a story told by Sir Francis
Doyle which illustrates, after the rude
fashion of our forebears, the value of endurance
as an element of education. Dr.
Keate, the terrible head-master of Eton,
encountered one winter morning a small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
boy crying miserably, and asked him
what was the matter. The child replied
that he was cold. “Cold!” roared Keate.
“You must put up with cold, sir! You
are not at a girls’ school.”</p>

<p>It is a horrid anecdote, and I am kind-hearted
enough to wish that Dr. Keate,
who was not without his genial moods,
had taken the lad to some generous fire
(presuming such a thing was to be found),
and had warmed his frozen hands and
feet. But it so chanced that in that little
snivelling boy there lurked a spark of
pride and a spark of fun, and both ignited
at the rough touch of the master. He
probably stopped crying, and he certainly
remembered the sharp appeal to manhood.
Fifteen years later he charged
with the Third Dragoons at the strongly
entrenched Sikhs (thirty thousand of the
best fighting men of the Khalsa) on the
curving banks of the Sutlej. When
the word was given, he turned to his
superior officer, a fellow Etonian who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
was scanning the stout walls and the
belching guns. “As old Keate would say,
this is no girls’ school,” he chuckled; and
rode to his death on the battlefield of
Sobraon, which gave Lahore to England.</p>

<p>Contemplating which incident, and
many like it, we become aware that ease
is not the only good in a world consecrated
to the heroic business of living
and of dying.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="The_Modest_Immigrant">The Modest Immigrant</h2>
</div>


<p>It is now nearly fifty years since Mr.
Lowell wrote his famous essay, “On
a Certain Condescension in Foreigners”;
an essay in which justifiable
irritation prompted the telling of plain
truths, and an irrepressible sense of humour
made these truths amusing. It was
well for Mr. Lowell that he was seldom
too angry to laugh, and he knew, as only
a man of the world can know, the saving
grace of laughter. Therefore, though
confessedly unable to understand why
foreigners should be persuaded that “by
doing this country the favour of coming
to it, they have laid every native thereof
under an obligation,” he was willing in
certain light-minded moods to acquit
himself honourably of the debt. When a
genteel German mendicant presented a
letter, “professedly written by a benevolent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
American clergyman,” and certifying
that the bearer thereof had long
“sofered with rheumatic paints in his
limps,” Mr. Lowell rightly considered
that a composition so rich in the naïveté
common to all Teuton mendacities was
worth the money asked. When a French
traveller assured him, with delightful <i>bon-homie</i>,
that Englishmen became Americanized
so rapidly that “they even
begin to talk through their noses, just
like you do,” the only comment of our
representative American was that he felt
ravished by this testimony to the assimilating
powers of democracy.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it is well in these years
of grace to reread Mr. Lowell’s essay,
partly because of its sturdy and dignified
Americanism, and partly because we
can then compare his limited experiences
with our own. We can also speculate
pleasantly upon his frame of mind could
he have lived to hear Mrs. Amadeus Grabau
(Mary Antin) say, “Lowell would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
agree with me,”—the point of agreement
being the relative virtues of the
Pilgrim Fathers and the average immigrant
of to-day. When the dead are
quoted in this fashion and nothing happens,
then we know that, despite the assurances
of Sir Oliver Lodge, the seal
of silence is unbroken. Were the proud
souls who have left us, able and willing
to return, it would not be to reveal the
whereabouts of a lost penknife, but to
give the lie to the words which are
spoken in their name.</p>

<p>The condescension which Mr. Lowell
observed and analyzed was in his day
the shining quality of foreigners who
visit our shores. Immigrants were then
less aggressive and less profoundly self-conscious
than they are now, and it is
the immigrant who counts. It is his arrogance,
not the misapprehension of the
tourist, or the innocent pride of the
lecturer, which constitutes a peril to our
republic. We can all of us afford to smile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
with Mr. Lowell at the men and women
who, while accepting our hospitality,
“make no secret of regarding us as the
goose bound to deliver them a golden
egg in return for their cackle.” That they
should not hesitate to come without
equipment, without experience, without
even a fitness for their task, seems to us
perfectly natural. Perhaps they have written
books which none of us have read, or
edited periodicals which none of us have
seen. Perhaps they have known celebrities
of whom few of us have heard. It
does not matter in the least. From the
days when Miss Rose Kingsley came to
tell us the worth of French art (does not
the ocean roll between New York and
Paris?), to the days when Mrs. Pankhurst
came to tell us the worth of womanhood
(does not the ocean roll between Boston
Common and Hyde Park?), we have listened
patiently, and paid generously, and
received scant courtesy for our pains. “I
find it so strange,” said an Englishman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
to me three years ago, “to see my wife
lecturing over the United States. It is a
thing she would not dream of doing at
home. In fact, nobody would go to hear
her, you know.”</p>

<p>But lectures are transient things, forgiven
as soon as forgotten. Even the
books which are written about us make
no painful bid for immortality. And
though our visitors patronize us, they
seldom fail to throw us a kind word now
and then. Sometimes a sweet-tempered
and very hurried traveller, like Mr. Arnold
Bennett, is good enough to praise everything
he thinks he has seen. Before August,
1914, it was not the habit of our
guests to scold or threaten us. That privilege
had hitherto been reserved for the
alien, who, having done us the honour of
accepting citizenship, wields his vote as
a cudgel, bidding us beware the weapon
we have amiably placed in his hands.</p>

<p>Signor Ferrero, an acute and friendly
critic, pronounces Americans to be the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
mystics of the modern world, because
they sacrifice their welfare to a sentiment;
because they believe in the miracle of
the melting-pot, which, like Medea’s
magic cauldron, will turn the old and decrepit
races of Europe into a young and
vigorous people, new-born in soul and
body. No other nation cherishes this illusion.
An Englishman knows that a
Russian Jew cannot in five years, or in
twenty-five years, become English; that
his standards and ideals are not convertible
into English standards and ideals. A
Frenchman does not see in a Bulgarian
or a Czech the making of another
Frenchman. Our immigrants may be as
good as we are. Sometimes we are told
they are better, that we might “learn a
lesson” from the least promising among
them. But no one can deny that they are
different; in many instances, radically
and permanently different. And to make
a sow’s ear out of a silk purse is just as
difficult as the reverse operation. Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
Horace Kallen has put the case into a
few clear conclusive words when he says,
“Only men who are alike in origin and
spirit, and not abstractly, can be truly
equal, and maintain that inward unanimity
of action and outlook which
makes a national life.”</p>

<p>To look for “inward unanimity”
among the seething mass of immigrants
who have nothing more in common with
one another than they have with us, is
to tax credulity too far. The utmost we
can hope is that their mutual antagonisms
will neutralize their voting power,
and keep our necks free from an alien
yoke. Those of us who have lived more
than half a century have seen strange
fluctuations in the fortunes of the foreign-born.
In 1883, when the Brooklyn
Bridge was finished, the Irishmen of New
York made a formal protest against its
being opened on Queen Victoria’s birthday,
lest this chance occurrence should
be misconstrued into a compliment to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
England. In 1915, a band in Saint Patrick’s
parade was halted, and forbidden
to play “Tipperary” before Cardinal
Farley’s residence, lest these cheerful
strains should be misconstrued into an insult
to Germany. The Reverend Thomas
Thornton, speaking to the Knights of
Columbus, prophesied mournfully that
the time was at hand when Catholic voters
in the United States would be “reduced
to the condition of tribute-paying
aliens.” Men smiled when they heard
this, reflecting that the Irish officeholder
had not yet been consigned to oblivion;
but the speaker had seen with a clear eye
the marshalling of strange forces, destined
to drive the first comer from authority.
Some weeks later, the “Jewish
Tribune” boasted that the angry protest
voiced by Catholics against the sending
of Signor Ernesto Nathan as commissioner
to the San Francisco Fair had
been “checked in its infancy” by the
power of the Jewish press.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span></p>

<p>It is all very lively and interesting, but
where does the American come in? What
place is reserved for him in the commonwealth
which his heroic toil and heroic
sacrifices moulded into what Washington
proudly called a “respectable nation”?
The truth is contemptuously
flung at us by Mary Antin, when she says
that the descendants of the men who
made America are not numerous enough
to “swing a presidential election.” And
if a negligible factor now, what depths of
insignificance will be their portion in the
future? I heard told with glee—the glee
which expresses pure American unconcern—a
story of a public school in one
of our large eastern cities. A visitor of an
investigating turn of mind asked the pupils
of various nationalities, Germans,
Polacks, Russian Jews, Italians, Armenians
and Greeks, to stand up in turn.
When the long list was seemingly exhausted,
he bethought himself of a nation
he had overlooked, and said, “Now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
let the American children arise!” Whereupon
one lone, lorn little black boy stood
up to represent the native-born.</p>

<p>It is hardly surprising that these foreign
children, recognizing the strength
of numbers, should take exception to
our time-honoured methods of education.
Little boys of a socialistic turn of
mind refuse to salute the flag, because it
is a military emblem. Little boys of a
rationalistic turn of mind refuse to read
the Bible,—any portion of the Bible,—because
its assertions are unscientific.
Little Jewish boys and girls refuse to
sing the “Battle Hymn of the Republic,”
because of its unguarded allusions to
Bethlehem and Calvary. Indeed, any
official recognition of the Deity offends
the susceptibilities of some of our future
citizens; and their perplexed teachers
are bidden to eliminate from their programme
“any exercises which the pupils
consider objectionable.”</p>

<p>A few years ago I was asked to speak<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
to a large class of immigrant working-girls,
for whose benefit philanthropic
women had planned evening classes,
dexterously enlivened by a variety of
entertainments. I was not sure whether
I ranked as useful or amusing, and the
number of topics I was bidden to tactfully
avoid, added to my misgivings;
when suddenly all doubts were dispelled
by the superintendent saying sweetly,
“Oh, Miss Repplier, you were asked to
speak for forty minutes; but I think your
address had better be cut down to twenty-five.
The girls are eager for their ice-cream.”</p>

<p>I said I sympathized with so reasonable
an impatience. Even at my advanced
age, I prefer ice-cream to lectures.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>

<p class="p0">But what did not flatter me was the clear
understanding that my audience listened
to me, or at least sat tolerantly for twenty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
minutes (I curtailed my already cur-tail’d
cur), because their reward, in the shape
of ice-cream, was near at hand. Just as
some manufacturers provide baths for
their employees, and then, recognizing
the prejudices of the foreign-born, pay
the men for taking the baths provided,
so the good ladies who had served me
up as a mental refreshment for their protégées,
paid the girls for being so obliging
as to listen to me.</p>

<p>Miss Addams has reproached us most
unjustly for our contemptuous disregard
of the immigrant; and Mrs. Percy Pennybacker,
president of the General Federation
of Women’s Clubs, has been wrought
to such a pitch of indignation over what
she considers our unwarranted superciliousness,
that she writes fervidly in the
“Ladies’ Home Journal,” “I love my
country; I adore her; but at times I hope
that some great shock may cause us to
drop the mantle of conceit that we so
proudly wrap about us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span></p>

<p>This well-wisher is in a fair way to see
her desires realized. We may be left
naked and shivering sooner than she
anticipates. If concessions to the Irish
vote failed to teach us humility,—perhaps
because the Irish have a winning
way of overriding barriers (“What’s
the Constitution between friends?”),—other
immigrants are less urbane in stripping
us of our pride. “A German,” said
Mr. Lowell feelingly, “is not always nice in
concealing his contempt”; and if this was
his attitude in 1868, to what superb heights
of disdain has he risen by 1916! A German
ambassador has derided diplomatic
conventions, and has addressed his official
communication, over the head of
the Administration, to German voters in
the United States, sparing no pains to
make his words offensive. German officials
have sought to undermine our neutrality
and imperil our safety. In the
opening months of the war, a German
professor at Harvard, who for years has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
received courteous and honourable treatment
at the hands of Americans, threatened
us insolently with the “crushing
power” of the German vote; and bade
us beware of the punishment which
twenty-five millions of citizens, “in whose
homes lives the memory of German ancestors,”
would inflict upon their fellow
citizens of less august and martial stock.
The “Frankfurter Zeitung” published a
cheering letter from an American Congressman,
assuring a German correspondent
that his countrymen know how
to make themselves heard, and expressing
hearty hopes that Germany would
triumph over her “perfidious” rival.</p>

<p>Is it any wonder that, stimulated by
these brilliant examples, the average
“German-American” should wax scornful,
and despise his unhyphenated fellow
citizens? Is it any wonder that he should
turn bully, and threaten us with his vote,—the
vote which was confided to his
sacred honour for the preservation of our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
country’s liberty? A circular distributed
before the Chicago elections in 1915
stated in the plainest possible words that
the German’s first allegiance was to imperial
Germany, and not to the Republic
he had sworn to serve:—</p>

<p>“Chicago has a larger German population
than any city in the world, excepting
Berlin and Vienna; and the German-,
Austrian-, and Hungarian-Americans
should, at this coming election, <i>set aside
every other consideration</i>, and vote as a
unit for Robert M. Sweitzer. Stand
shoulder to shoulder in this election, as
our countrymen in the trenches and on
the high seas are fighting for the preservation
of our dear Fatherland. The
election of a German-American would
be a fitting answer to the defamers of
the Fatherland, would cause a tremendous
moral effect throughout the United
States, and would reëcho in Germany,
Austria, and Hungary.”</p>

<p>The “moral effect” of this appeal was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
not precisely what its authors had anticipated.
Men asked themselves in bewilderment
and wrath what the dear Fatherland,
any more than dear Dahomey or
the beloved Congo, had to do with the
Chicago elections? They have been putting
similar questions ever since.</p>

<p>Some months later, the German-American
Central Society of Passaic, uniting
itself with the German-American National
Alliance, called for assistance in
these glowing words:—</p>

<p>“Come all of you German societies,
German men, and German women, so
that united offensively and defensively
[<i>zum Schutz und Trutz verein</i>] with
weapons of the spirit, we may help our
beloved Germany onward.”</p>

<p>“Weapons of the spirit!” If this means
prayer and supplication, the matter lies
between the petitioner and his God. If
it means exhortations, pamphlets, and
platform oratory, the champion of Germany
stands well within his rights. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
the next paragraph drops all figures of
speech, and states the real issue with
abrupt and startling distinctness:—</p>

<p>“We ask for your speedy decision with
respect to your acquiescence, in order to
permit of an effective participation and
lead in the spring campaign of 1915.”</p>

<p>In plain words, the spiritual weapon
with which the German-American proposes
to fight the battle of Germany is
the American ballot. When the franchise
was granted to him, or to his father, or
to his grandfather (whichever did this
country the honour of first accepting citizenship),
a solemn oath was sworn.
Allegiance to a foreign government was
forever disowned; fealty to the government
of the United States was vowed.
He who uses his vote to further the interests
of a European state is a perjured
man, and that he should dare to threaten
us with the power of his perjury is the
height of arrogant ill-doing. That such
a question as “What is the proportion of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
votes which the Germans of your section
control?” should be asked by German
agents, and answered by German newspapers,
affronts our nation’s honour, soils
a sacred trust by ill-usage, and tears our
neutrality to rags.</p>

<p>When the Lusitania was sunk, and the
horror of the deed shamed all Christendom,
save only those strange residents
of Berlin who received the news with
“enthusiasm,” and “joyful pride,” the
first word tactfully whispered in our ear
was that, while we might regret the
drowning of Americans, we were impotent
to resent it. And this impotence was
to be a concession to the foreign vote.
God only knows of what material Germany
thought we were made,—putty,
or gutta-percha, or sun-baked mud?
Certainly not of flesh and blood. Certainly
not with hearts to bleed, or souls to
burn. Every comment vouchsafed by the
German press placed us in the catalogue
of worms warranted not to turn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span></p>

<p>The contempt which the German “is
not always nice in concealing” shines
with a chastened lustre in the words and
deeds of other foreign-born citizens.
They accept the vote which we enthusiastically
press upon them, regarding it
as an asset, sometimes of marketable
value, sometimes serving a stronger and
more enduring purpose, always as an esteemed
protection against the military
service exacted by their own governments.
They do not come to us “with
gifts in their hands,”—to quote Mr.
Lowell. They are for the most part destitute,
not only of money, but of knowledge,
of useful attainments, of any serviceable
mental equipment. Mr. Edward Alsworth
Ross, who is not without experience, confesses
ruefully that the immigrant seldom
brings in his intellectual baggage anything
of use to us; and that the admission
into our electorate of “backward
men”—men whose mental, moral, and
physical standards are lower than our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
own—must inevitably retard our social
progress, and thrust us behind the more
uniformly civilized nations of the world.</p>

<p>Meditating on these disagreeable facts,
we find ourselves confronted by sentimentalists
who say that if we would only
be kind and brotherly, the sloping foreheads
would grow high, the narrow
shoulders broad, the Pole would become
peaceable, the Greek honest, the Slav
clean, the Sicilian would give up murder
as a pastime, the Jew would lose his
“monstrous love of gain.” Enthusiastic
promoters of the “National Americanization
Committee”—a crusade full of
promise for the future—have talked to
us so much and so sternly about our duty
to the immigrant, our neglect of the immigrant,
our debt to the immigrant, our
need of the immigrant, that we have been
no less humiliated than bewildered by
their eloquence. Mr. Roosevelt alone, of
all their orators, has had the hardihood
to say bluntly that citizenship implies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
service as well as protection; that the
debt contracted by the citizen to the state
is as binding as that contracted by the
state to the citizen; that a voter who cannot
speak English is an absurdity no less
than a peril; and that all who seek the
franchise should be compelled to accept
without demur our laws, our language,
our national policy, our requisitions civil
and military. This is what naturalization
implies.</p>

<p>That saving phrase, “It is the law,”
which made possible the civilization of
Rome, and which has been the foundation
of all great civilizations before and
since, has little weight or sanctity for our
immigrants. They resent legal interference,
especially the punishment of crime,
in a very spirited fashion. When Mr.
Samuel Gompers defended the McNamaras
and their “social war” murders
before a subcommittee of the United
States Senate, he said with feeling that
the mere fact that these men should have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
come to look upon dynamite as the only
defence left them against the tyranny of
capital, was a “terrible charge against
society.” It was an appeal very pleasantly
suggestive of the highwayman,
who, having attacked and robbed Lord
Derby and Mr. Grenville, said reproachfully
to his victims, “What scoundrels you
must be to fire at a gentleman who risks
his life upon the road!”</p>

<p>If Cicero lowered his voice when he
spoke of the Jews, fearing the enmity
of this strong and clannish people, the
American, who is far from enjoying Cicero’s
prestige, must be doubly cautious
lest he give offence. Yet surely, if there
is an immigrant who owes us everything,
it is the Jew. Even our spasmodic and
utterly futile efforts to restrict immigration
always leave him a loophole of escape,
because he controls the National
Liberal Immigration League.</p>

<p>It is our custom to assume that the
Russian Jew is invariably a fugitive from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
religious persecution, and we liken him
in this regard to the best and noblest of
our early settlers. But the Puritan, the
Quaker, and the Huguenot sacrificed
temporal well-being for liberty of conscience.
They left conditions of comfort,
and the benefits of a high civilization, to
develop the resources of a virgin land,
and build for themselves homes in the
wilderness. They practised the stern virtues
of courage, fortitude, and a most
splendid industry. Had the Pilgrim Fathers
been met on Plymouth Rock by
immigration officials; had their children
been placed immediately in good free
schools, and given the care of doctors,
dentists, and nurses; had they found
themselves in infinitely better circumstances
than they had ever enjoyed in
England, indulging in undreamed-of
luxuries, and taught by kind-hearted
philanthropists,—what pioneer virtues
would they have developed, what sons
would they have bred, what honours<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
would history have accorded them? If
our early settlers were masterful, they
earned the right to mastery, and the
price they paid for it was endurance. To
the sacrifices which they made, to their
high courage and heroic labours, we owe
law, liberty, and well-being.</p>

<p>It is because the Jew has received
from us so much, and given us so little,
that his masterfulness affronts our sense
of decency. When the Jewish Anti-Defamation
League boasts—perhaps without
warranty—that it has taken “the
first and most important step in excluding
the ‘Merchant of Venice’ from the
curriculum of the grammar and high
schools of this country, by having the
play removed from the list of requirements
laid down by the Collegiate Entrance
Requirement Board,” we feel that
a joke has been carried too far. Nobody
can seriously associate the “Merchant of
Venice” with a defamation of the Jewish
character. Heaven knows, the part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
played by Christians in that immortal
drama has never left us puffed up with
pride. Nevertheless, being less thin-skinned,
or perhaps more sure of ourselves,
we have grown attached to the
play, and should not relish its banishment
by the decree of aliens.</p>

<p>And what if our Italian immigrants
should take exception to the character of
Iago, and demand that “Othello” should
be excluded from the schools? What if
the Sicilians should find themselves
wounded in spirit by the behaviour of
Leontes (compared with whom Shylock
and Iago are gentlemen), and deny us
the “Winter’s Tale”? What if the Bohemians
(a fast-increasing body of voters)
should complain that their peddlers are
honest men, shamefully slandered by the
rogueries of Autolycus? If all our foreign
citizens become in turn as sensitive as
Hebrews, we may find ourselves reduced
to the fairy scenes from the “Tempest”
and the “Midsummer Night’s Dream.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span></p>

<p>Another victory claimed by the “Jewish
Tribune” is that the Associated Press
has been made to feel that the words
“Jew” and “Hebrew” should be avoided
in connection with criminals. “The religious
denomination of malefactors should
not be referred to. It is now generally
understood by newspapers that it is just
as improper to describe a malefactor by
stating that he is a Jew, as it would be
to describe such a person as a Catholic
or a Methodist.”</p>

<p>Does this mean that the Jew no longer
claims any racial distinction, that he has
no genealogy, no pedigree, no place in
history, nothing by which he may be
classified but church membership? Is the
simple dictionary definition, “Jew. An
Israelite; a person of the Hebrew race,”
without any significance? We may call
a Greek pickpocket a Greek, or a Polish
rioter a Pole, or an Italian murderer an
Italian; but we may not call a Jewish
procurer a Jew, because that word refers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
only to his attendance at the synagogue.
May we then speak of a scholar,
a musician, a scientist, a philanthropist,
as a Jew? Only—by this ruling—as we
might speak of one as a Catholic or a
Methodist, only in reference to his “religious
denomination.” If he chances to be
unsectarian, then, as he is also raceless, he
cannot be called anything at all. If the
word “Jew” be out of place in the police
courts, it is equally out of place in colleges,
learned societies, and encyclopædias.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that, after the
publication of “Oliver Twist,” a bitter protest
was raised by English Jews against
the character of Fagin, or rather against
the fact that the merry old gentleman is
alluded to frequently as a Jew. The complainants
said—what the “Jewish Tribune”
now says—that the use of the
word as an indicatory substantive was an
insult to their creed. Dickens, who had
never thought of Fagin as having any
creed, who had never associated him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
with religious observances of any kind,
was puzzled and pained at having unwittingly
given offence; and strove to
make clear that, when he said “Jew,” he
meant an Israelite, and not a frequenter of
the synagogue. Years afterward he made
a peace-offering in the person of Riah,
who plays the part of a good Samaritan
in “Our Mutual Friend,” and who is to
Fagin as skimmed milk to brandy.</p>

<p>It is worthy of note that whenever any
strong and noble emotion grips our Jewish
citizens, they speedily forget their
antipathy to the word “Jew.” For years
past they have objected to the use of the
word by charitable associations, even
when there was no hint of criminality to
shame it. They have asked that visiting
nurses should not report service to Jewish
homes, or Jewish patients. Homes
and patients should be placed upon record
as Russian or Polish,—whichever
the case might be. The race was specifically
denied. The Semite was sunk in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
Slav. But when there came a cry for help
from the war-stricken Jews of Europe,
the Jews of America responded with exalted
enthusiasm. Jew called to Jew, and
the great tie of kindred asserted itself
supremely. It was not as co-religionists,
but as brothers-in-blood, that New York
millionaires, who had never entered a
synagogue, stretched out their hands in
aid. Women stripped off their jewels,
and offered this glittering tribute, as they
might have done in the fighting days of
Israel. Young and old, rich and poor,
gave with unstinted compassion. Gentiles
contributed generously to the fund,
and Christian churches asked the coöperation
of Christian congregations. To
some Jews the thought must have occurred
that America had not dealt harshly
by her immigrants, when they could command
millions for their impoverished
brethren in Europe.</p>

<p>Therefore it behooves the men and
women who have been well received, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
who have responded ably to the opportunities
offered them by our country’s
superb liberality, to be a little more lenient
to our shortcomings. We confess
them readily enough; but we feel that
those whom we have befriended should
not be the ones to dwell upon them with
too much gusto. There are situations in
the world which imperiously dictate urbanity.
“Steadily as I worked to win
America,” writes Mary Antin, “America
advanced to lie at my feet,”—a poodle-like
attitude which ought to disarm criticism.
When this clever young woman
tells us that she “took possession of Beacon
Street” (a goodly heritage), and
there “drank afternoon tea with gentle
ladies whose hands were as delicate as
their porcelain cups,” we feel well content
at this swift recognition of energy
and ability. It is not the first time such
pleasant things have happened, and it
will not be the last. But why should the
recipient of so much attention be the one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
to scold us harshly, to rail at conditions
she imperfectly understands, to reproach
us for our ill-mannered children (whom we
fear she must have met in Beacon Street),
our slackness in duty, our failure to observe
the precepts and fulfil the intentions
of those pioneers whom she kindly,
but confusedly, calls “<i>our</i> forefathers.”</p>

<p>It is the hopeless old story of opposing
races, of people unable to understand
one another because they have no mutual
standards, no common denominator.
Mary Antin is perfectly sincere, and, from
her point of view, justified, in bidding
us remember that among the Harrison
Avenue tenants, “who pitch rubbish
through their windows,” was the grocer
whose kindness helped to keep her at
school. And she adds with sublime because
unconscious egotism, “Let the City
Fathers strike the balance.” But Elizabeth
Robins Pennell is also sincere, and,
from <i>her</i> point of view, justified, when
she says with exceeding bitterness that,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
if Philadelphia blossomed like the rose
with Mary Antins, the city would be but
ill repaid for the degradation of her noble
old streets, now transformed into foul and
filthy slums. Dirt is a valuable asset in
the immigrant’s hands. With its help
he drives away decent neighbours, and
brings property down to his level and
his purse. The ill-fated Philadelphian is
literally pushed out of his home—the
only place, sighs Mrs. Pennell, where he
wants to live—by conditions which he
is unable to avert, and unwilling, as well
as unfitted, to endure.</p>

<p>It is part of the unreality of modern
sentimentalism that we should have a
strong sense of duty toward all the nations
of the world except our own. We
see plainly what we owe to the Magyar
and the Levantine, but we have no concern
for the Virginian or the Pennsylvanian.
The capitalist and the sentimentalist
play into each other’s hands, and
neither takes thought of our country’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
irrational present and imperilled future.
We go on keeping a “civic kindergarten”
for backward aliens, and we go on
mutely suffering reproach for not advancing
our pupils more rapidly. In the
industrial town of New Britain, Connecticut,
the foreign population is nine times
greater than the native population, which
is a hideous thing to contemplate. Twenty
nationalities are represented, eighteen
languages are spoken. The handful of
Americans, who are supposed to leaven
this heavy and heterogeneous mass, take
their duties very seriously. Schools, playgrounds,
clubs, night-classes, vacation
classes, gymnasiums, visiting nurses,
milk-stations, charitable organizations,
a city mission with numerous interpreters,
a free library with books and newspapers
in divers tongues, all the leavening machinery
is kept in active service for the
hard task of civic betterment. Yet it was
in New Britain that an immigrant was
found who, after sixteen years’ residence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
in the United States, was not aware that
he might, if he chose, become a citizen;
and this incident, Mary Antin considers
a heavy indictment against the community.
“It makes a sensitive American,”
she writes passionately, “choke
with indignation.”</p>

<p>It makes an exasperated American
choke with angry laughter to have the
case put that way. The ballot is not
necessary to safe, decent, and prosperous
living. A good many millions of women
have made shift to live safely, decently,
and prosperously without it. If it is to be
regarded as an asset to the immigrant,
then his own friends, his own people, the
voters of his own race, might (in the welcome
absence of political bosses) be the
ones to press it upon his acceptance. If
it be considered as a safeguard for the
Republic, we cannot but feel that this
highly intelligent alien might be spared
permanently from the electorate.</p>

<p>For the first nine months of the war,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
when Italy’s neutrality swayed in the
conflicting currents of national pride and
national precaution, and no one could
foretell what the end would be, a young
Italian gardener, employed near Philadelphia,
suffered dismal doubts concerning
the expediency of naturalization. He was
a frugal person, devoid of high political
instincts. He did not covet a vote to sell,
and he did not want to pay the modest
cost of becoming an American citizen.
He preferred keeping his money and
staying what he was, provided always
that Italy remained at peace. But the
prospect of Italy’s going to war disposed
him to look favourably upon the safeguard
of a foreign allegiance. Being unable
to decipher the newspapers, he made
anxious inquiries every morning. If the
headlines read, “Italy unlikely to abandon
attitude of neutrality,” he settled
down contentedly to his day’s work. If the
headlines read, “Austria refuses guarantee.
Italy sending troops to northern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
frontier,” he became once more a prey
to indecision. Then came the May days
when doubt was turned to certainty. Italy,
long straining at the leash, plunged into
the conflict. Thousands of Italians in the
United States stood ready to fight for
their country, to give back to her, if need
be, the lives which they might have held
safe. But one peace-loving gardener hurried
to Philadelphia, applied for his naturalization
papers, failed utterly to pass the
casual tests which would have secured
them, grew frightened and demoralized
by failure, appealed desperately to his
employer, and, with a little timely aid,
was pitched shivering into citizenship.</p>

<p>If ever there comes a cloud between
the United States and Italy, this doughty
“Italian-American” will, I am sure, be
found fighting with “weapons of the
spirit” for the welfare of his adored and
endangered “Fatherland.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Waiting">Waiting</h2>
</div>


<p>In the most esteemed of his advisory
poems, Mr. Longfellow recommends
his readers to be “up and doing,”
and at the same time learn “to labour
and to wait.” Having, all of us, imbibed
these sentiments in their harmonious setting
when we were at school, we have,
all of us, endeavoured for many months
to put such conflicting precepts into practice.
Mr. Longfellow, it will be remembered,
gave precedence to his “up and
doing” line; but this may have been due
to the exigencies of verse. We began by
waiting, and we waited long. Our deliberation
has seemed to border on paralysis.
But back of this superhuman patience—rewarded
by repeated insult and
repeated injury—was a toughening resolution
which snatched from insult and injury
the bitter fruit of knowledge. We are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
emerging from this period of suspense a
sadder and a wiser people, keenly aware
of dangers which, a year ago, seemed
negligible, fully determined to front such
dangers with courage and with understanding.</p>

<p>When Germany struck her first blow at
Belgium, the neutral nations silently acquiesced
in this breach of good faith. The
burning of Louvain, the destruction of the
Cathedral of Rheims, were but the first
fruits of this sinister silence. The sinking
of the Lusitania followed in the orderly
sequence of events. It was a deliberate
expression of defiance and contempt, a
gauntlet thrown to the world. The lives
it cost, the innocence and helplessness of
the drowned passengers, their number
and their nationalities, all combined to
make this novelty in warfare exactly what
Germany meant it to be. We Americans
had tried (and it had been hard
work) to bear tranquilly the misfortunes
of others. Now let us apply our philosophy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
to ourselves. Herr Erich von Salzmann
voiced the sentiment of his countrymen
when he said in the Berlin “Lokal
Anzeiger”:—</p>

<p>“The Lusitania is no more. Only those
who have travelled by sea can appreciate
the extraordinary impression which this
news will make all over the world....
The fact that it was we Germans who
destroyed this ship must make us proud
of ourselves. The Lusitania case will obtain
for us more respect than a hundred
battles won on land.”</p>

<p>The severing of fear from respect is a
subtlety which has not penetrated the
mind of the Prussian. He recognizes no
such distinction, because his doctrine of
efficiency embraces the doctrine of frightfulness.
His Kultur is free from any
ethical bias. The fact that we may greatly
fear lust, cruelty, and other forms of violence,
without in the least respecting these
qualities, has no significance for him.
He frankly does not care. If he can teach<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
the French, the English, or the Americans
to fear him in 1916, as he taught
the Chinese to fear him in 1900, and by
the same methods, he will be well content.</p>

<p>But was it fear which paralyzed us
when we heard that American women
and children had been sacrificed as ruthlessly
as were the Chinese women and
children sixteen years ago? The fashion
in which American gentlemen died on the
Lusitania, as on the Titanic, may well
acquit us of any charge of cowardice.
Whatever “respect” ensued from that
pitiless massacre was won by the victims,
not by the perpetrators thereof. Why,
then, when the news was brought, did
we feverishly urge one another to “keep
calm”? Why did we chatter day after
day about “rocking the boat,” as though
unaware that the blow which sent us reeling
and quivering was struck by a foreign
hand? Why did we let pass the supreme
moment of action, and settle down to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
months of controversy? And what have
we gained by delay?</p>

<p>All these questions have been answered
many times to the satisfaction and
dissatisfaction of the querists. If we had
severed diplomatic and commercial relations
with Germany, she might have declared
war, and we did not want to fight;
not, at least, on such provocation as she
had given us, and with such ships and
munitions as we could command. There
was a well-founded conviction that no
step involving the safety of the nation
should be taken impetuously, or under
the influence of resentment, or without
discreet calculation of ways and means.
There was also a rational hope that Germany
might be induced to disavow the
savage slaughter of noncombatants, and
promise redress. And always in the
background of our consciousness was a
lurking hope that the pen would prove
mightier than the sword. The copy-books
say that it is mightier, and where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
shall we look for wisdom, if not to the
counsels of the copy-book!</p>

<p>The correspondence which ensued between
the Administration in Washington
and the Imperial Government in
Berlin was so remarkable that it may well
serve as a model for generations yet unborn.
If the Polite Letter-Writer ever
broadens its sphere to embrace diplomatic
relations, it could not do better
than reprint these admirable specimens
of what was thought to be a lost art.
The urbanity and firmness of each American
note filled us with justifiable pride.
Also with a less justifiable elation, which
was always dissipated by the arrival of
a German note, equally urbane and
equally firm. Germany was more than
willing to state at length and at leisure
her reasons for sinking merchant ships,
provided she could safely and uninterruptedly
continue the practice. Such
warfare she defined in her note of July
9 as a “sacred duty.” “If the Imperial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
Government were derelict in these duties,
it would be guilty before God and history
of the violation of those principles
of highest humanity which are the foundation
of every national existence.”</p>

<p>The German is certainly at home in
Zion. If his god be a trifle exacting in
the matter of human sacrifice, he is
otherwise the most pliant and accommodating
of deities. It is one of our
many disadvantages that we have no
American god. Only the Divinity, whose
awful name is, by comment consent,
omitted from diplomatic correspondence.</p>

<p>When our hopes sank lowest and our
hearts burned hottest, the note of September
1, 1915, brought its welcome message
of concession. It is as little worth
while to analyze the motives which
prompted this change of front as it is
worth while to speculate upon its sincerity.
In the light of subsequent events, we
are painfully aware that our satisfaction
was excessive, our self-congratulations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
unwarranted, our jubilant editorials a
trifle overcharged. But at the time we
believed what we wanted to believe, we
joyfully assumed that Germany had been
converted to the ways of humanity,
and that she stood ready to anger her
own people for the sake of conciliating
ours.</p>

<p>Why the submarine warfare should
have so endeared itself to the Teuton
heart is a problem for psychologists to
elucidate. There is little about it to evoke
a generous enthusiasm. It lacks heroic
qualities. The singularly loathsome song
which celebrated the sinking of the Lusitania
is as remote in spirit from such
brave verse as “Admirals All,” as those
old sea-dogs were remote in spirit from
the foul work of Von Tirpitz. No flight of
fancy can conceive of Nelson counting up
the women and children he had drowned.
And because the whole wretched business
sickened as well as affronted us, we
hailed with unutterable relief any modification<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
of its violence. For the first time
in many months our souls were lightened
of their load. We felt calm enough to
review the summer of suspense, and to
ask ourselves sincerely and soberly what
were the lessons that it had taught us.</p>

<p>The agitation produced in this country
by a terrible—and to us unexpected—European
war was intensified in the
spring of 1915 by the discovery that we
were not so immune as we thought ourselves.
It dawned slowly on men’s minds
that the sacrifice of the nation’s honour
might not after all secure the nation’s
safety; and this disagreeable doubt impelled
us to the still more disagreeable
consideration of our inadequate coast defences.
Then and then only were we
made aware of the chaotic confusion
which reigned in the minds of our vast
and unassimilated population. Then and
then only did we understand that perils
from without—remote and ascertainable—were
brought close and rendered hideously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
obscure by shameful coöperation
from within.</p>

<p>Ten years ago, two years ago, we
should have laughed to scorn the suggestion
that any body of American citizens—no
matter what their lineage—would
be disloyal to the State. A belief
in the integrity of citizenship was the first
article of our faith. To-day, the German-American
openly disavows all pretence
of loyalty, and says as plainly and as publicly
as he can that he will be betrayed
into no conflict with his “mother country,”
unless the United States be actually
invaded,—by which time the rest of us
would feel ourselves a trifle insecure. It
is strange that the men who, had they
remained in their mother country (a
choice which was always open to them),
would never have ventured a protest
against Germany’s aggressive warfare,
should here be so stoutly contumacious.
What would have happened to the president
of the New York State German-American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
Alliance, had he lived in Berlin
instead of in Brooklyn, and had he
spoken of the Kaiser as he dared to
speak of Mr. Wilson! The license which
the German (muzzled tightly in Germany)
permits himself in the United
States, is not unlike the license which the
newly emancipated slaves in the South
mistook for liberty when the Civil War
was ended. It takes as many generations
to make a freeman as it does to
make a gentleman.</p>

<p>The inevitable result of this outspoken
disloyalty at home was a determined and
very hurtful pressure from abroad. A big,
careless, self-confident nation is an easy
prey; and while we waited, not very watchfully,
Germany seized many chances to
hit us below the belt, and hit us hard.
The fomenting of strikes and labour agitation;
the threatening of German workmen
employed in American factories;
the misuse of the radio service at Sayville,
and the continued sending of code messages;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
the affidavits of Gustav Stahl before
the Federal Grand Jury, and his
assisted flight from the authorities; the
forged American passports with which
German spies wander over England and
the Continent; the diplomatic indiscretions—to
put it mildly—of German
and Austrian ambassadors; the mysterious
activities of German officials, which
we were too inexperienced to understand;—all
these things filled us with anger
and alarm. We could not resort to the
simple measures of Italians, who in Philadelphia
stoned the agents whom they
found trying to hold back reservists
about to sail for Italy. We bore each
fresh affront as though inured to provocation;
but we bore it understandingly,
and with deep resentment. If ever our
temper snaps beneath the strain, the anger
so slow to ignite will be equally hard
to extinguish.</p>

<p>Playing consciously or unconsciously
into the hands of Germany are the pacifists,—a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
compact body of men and
women, visibly strengthened by months
of indecision. Their methods may at
times be laughable, but we cannot afford
to laugh. I do not class under this head
any of the so-called “Neutrality Leagues,”
and “National Peace Councils,” which
aim at securing a German victory by withholding
munitions from the Allies. Such
“neutrals” are all partisans parading under
a borrowed name, which they have
rendered meaningless. They have a great
deal of money to spend on advertisements,
and posters, and mass meetings.
They can any day, in any town, fill a
hall with German sympathizers who are
all of one mind concerning the duty of
noncombatants. Their leaders are well
aware that law and usage permit, and
have long permitted, to neutral nations
the sale of munitions to belligerents.
Their followers for the most part know
this too. But it seems worth while to
profess ignorance. Something can always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
be accomplished by agitation, were
it only a murderous attack on a financier,
or the smuggling of dynamite into
the hold of a cargo boat.</p>

<p>But in reckoning up our perils, it is
the fanatic, not the hypocrite, who must
be taken into account. Sincerity is a terrible
weapon in the hands of the ill-advised.
There can be no contagion of folly,
unless that folly be sincere. And what
gives the uncompromising, because uncomprehending,
pacifist his dangerous
force is the fact that he is psychologically
as inevitable as were the Iconoclasts, or
the Thebaid anchorites, or any other historic
instance of recoil. He is the abnormal
product of abnormal conditions. The
fury of war has bred this child of peace.
The fumes of battle have stupefied him.
Aggression and defence, brutality and
heroism, the might of conquest and the
right of resistance, have for him no separate
significance. He is one who cannot
master—as every sane man must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
learn to master—the deadly sickness of
his soul.</p>

<p>To call the pacifist a coward is simple,
but not enlightening. Cowardice is a
natural and pervasive attribute of humanity.
Few of us can flatly disavow it.
There are women opposed to all war because
their sons might be shot. A popular
song—now employed to raise the
spirits of school-children—expresses this
sentiment. There are men opposed to
all war because they might themselves
be shot. So far, no music-hall ditty has
exalted them. But this normal human
cowardice is not infectious, save in the
heat of battle, where, happily, it is seldom
displayed. Infectious pacificism is
a revolt from war, irrespective of abstract
considerations like justice or injustice,
and of personal considerations like loss
or gain.</p>

<p>History is full of similar revolts, and
they have always overstepped the limits
of sanity. Because the pagan sensualist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
tended his body with loathsome solicitude,
the Christian ascetic subjected
his to loathsome indignities. The excesses
of the Roman baths sanctified the
uncleanliness of the early monasteries.
Just as inevitable is the reaction from
a ravenous war to non-resistance. Because
Germany’s armaments are powerful
enough to terrorize Europe, we are
bidden to weaken our defences. Because
France and Belgium have been attacked
and devastated, we are implored to take
no steps for self-protection. The appeal
sent out by Quaker citizens of Philadelphia—good
men, ready, no doubt,
to die as honourably as they have lived—was
at once a confession of faith and
a denial of duty. They asked that the
money of the taxpayer should be spent
in making “more homes happy,” and
they were content to leave the security
of these happy homes to the unassisted
care of Providence. To keep our powder
dry implied mistrust of God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span></p>

<p>That the authorities of Iowa should
strip the American flag of a white border,
neatly stitched around it by the pacifists
of Fort Dodge, was perhaps to be
expected. The action seems peremptory;
but if every society were permitted to
trim and patch our national emblem, we
should soon have as many flags as we
have disputants in the field. For months
the patient post-office officials passed on
without a murmur envelopes ornamented
with huge stamps, bearing pictures of a
cannon partly metamorphosed into a
ploughshare, a bloated child, and a pouncing
dove; and inscribed with these soul-subduing
lines:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I am in favour of world-wide peace,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Spread this idea, and war will cease.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The decoration of envelopes with strange
devices has long afforded a vent for
pent-up feelings. The peace-stamp was
nobly seconded by the “peace-pin,” a
white enamelled dove, carrying the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
motto, “World-Peace,” and destined—so
its wearers assured us—to prove
itself “one of the greatest factors in
eliminating prejudices and division
lines.”</p>

<p>Are these puerilities unworthy of consideration
and comment? They are not
so preposterous as was Mr. Wanamaker’s
suggestion that we should recompense
Germany for the trouble and expense she
had incurred in seizing Belgium by paying
her $100,000,000,000 for her spoils.
They are not so demoralizing as the
teaching of American school-children to
calculate how many bicycles they could
buy for the money spent on the battleship
Oregon, or how many tickets for a
ball-game could be provided at the price
of the American navy. The Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace is to
be congratulated on having devised a
scheme by which boys and girls can be
taught arithmetically to place pleasure
above patriotism. If Germans teach their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
children to deny themselves some portion
of their mid-day meal for the needs of
Germany, and Americans teach their
children to hold ball-games and bicycles
more sacred than the needs of America,
what chance have the men we rear
against men reared to discipline and
self-sacrifice!</p>

<p>When an anti-enlistment league can
be formed in a country which may possibly
be called to war, and anti-enlistment
pledges can be signed by young
men who promise never to enroll themselves
for their nation’s defence, we have
cause for apprehension. When college
students can be found petitioning for
peace at any price, we have cause for
wonder. When women who have suffered
nothing fling scorn at men who
have suffered all things, we have cause
in plenty for resentment.</p>

<p>Cause, too, for sorrow that such evil
words should be so lightly spoken. It
was but a dreary laugh that was provoked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
by Miss Addams’s picture of intoxicated
regiments bayoneting one another under
the stimulating influence of drink.
Laughter is hard to come by in these
dark days; but Heaven knows we should
gladly have foregone the mirth to have
been spared a slander so unworthy. The
snatching of honour from the soldier in
the hour of his utmost trial is possible
only to the pacifist, who, sick with pity
for pain, has lost all understanding of
the things which ennoble pain: of fidelity,
and courage, and the love of one’s
country, which, next to the love of God,
is the purest of all emotions which winnow
the souls of men.</p>

<p>The mad turmoil of folly and disaffection
was kept at high pressure by the
adroitness of the Imperial Government
in juggling with technicalities. While
we fed, like Hamlet, on the chameleon’s
dish, and, “promise-crammed,” debated
windily over words, ship after ship was
sunk, and fresh exonerations and pledges<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
were served up for our entertainment.
It became difficult even for German-Americans
to know just where they
stood, and how far they might fittingly
express their contempt for the United
States, without out-distancing the Fatherland.
When the “Friends of Peace”
in Chicago cheered the sinking of the
Hesperian,—an exploit naturally gratifying
to peaceful souls,—they were silenced
by more prudent members of the
convention, who bethought themselves
that this illustration of good faith might
in turn be politely regretted. All that
was left for these enthusiasts was to
praise Germany’s “magnanimity,” to
brag of her “historic friendship” for
America (apparently under the impression
that Lafayette was a Prussian officer),
to regret the “hysteria” of Americans
over the drowning of their
countrymen, and to ascribe the whole
war to the machinations of “Grey and
Asquith, and Delcassé, and Poincaré,”—“demons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
whom we should hiss and
howl into the abyss of Hell.”</p>

<p>There was plenty of disaffection in
1776, plenty in 1861; but we fought our
two great wars without dishonour. If
the Germans, well aware of our unpreparedness
and of our internal dissensions,
have flouted us unsparingly, it is
because they are, as they have always
been, densely incapable of reading the
souls of men. Let us not add to our own
peril by misreading the soul of Germany.
We lack her discipline, we lack her
unity, we lack her efficiency, the splendid
result of thirty years’ devotion to a
single purpose. It avails us very little
to analyze the “falling sickness” which
has made her so mighty. Dr. Lightner
Witmer, in a profoundly thoughtful and
dispassionate paper on “The Relation
of Intelligence to Efficiency,” diagnoses
her disease as “primitivism,”—“meaning
thereby a reversion in manners, customs,
and principles to what is characteristic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
of a lower level of civilization.”
Mr. Owen Wister, who is as poignantly
eloquent as Dr. Witmer is logical and
chill, reaches in “The Pentecost of Calamity”
a somewhat similar conclusion.
“The case of Germany is a hospital
case, a case for the alienist; the mania
of grandeur complemented by the mania
of persecution.” Even Mr. Bryan (always
a past-master of infelicitous argument)
tells us that a war with Germany is impossible,
because it would be like “challenging
an insane asylum;”—as if an
insane asylum which failed to restrain
its inmates could be left unchallenged
by the world.</p>

<p>It is unwise to minimize our danger
on the score of our saner judgment or
higher morality. These qualities may
win out in the future, but we are living
now. Germany is none the less terrible
because she is obsessed, and we are not
a whit safer because we recognize her obsession.
The German war-maps of Paris,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
cut into sections and directing which
sections were to be burned, are grim
warnings to the world. It is disturbing
to think how insensitive Paris was to
her peril when those maps were prepared.
It is disturbing to think that a
fool’s paradise is always the most popular
playground of humanity. In the
“Atlantic Monthly” for August, 1915, an
Englishman explained lucidly to American
readers (the only audience patient
enough to hear him) that non-resistance
is the road to security. Mr. Russell, “a
mathematician and a philosopher,” is
confident that if England would submit
passively to invasion, and refuse passively
to obey the invader, she would
suffer no great wrong. Had he read
“Sandford and Merton” when he was a
little boy, it might possibly occur to him
that Germany would treat the non-resisting
strikers as Mr. Barlow treated
Tommy, when that misguided child refused
to dig and hoe. Had he read the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
“Bryce report,”—which is not pleasant
reading,—he might feel less sure that
English homes and English women would
be safe from assault because they lacked
protectors.</p>

<p>The same happy confidence in our
receptivity and in our limitless good nature
was shown by Professor Kraus,
who, in the “Atlantic Monthly” for September,
1915, conveyed to us in the
plainest possible language his unfavourable
opinion of the Monroe Doctrine and
of its supporters. No German could be
less “nice” in concealing his contempt
than was this ingenuous contributor;
and nothing could be better for us than
to hear such words spoken at such a
time. The threat of a “general accounting”
was not even presented suavely to
our ears, but it left us no room for
doubt.</p>

<p>That two such arguments from two
such sources should have enlivened our
term of waiting is worthy of note. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
Englishman, seeing us beset by irrationalities,
added one more phantasy to our
load. The German, seeing us beset by
alarms, added one more menace to affright
us. Our patience is impervious to
folly and to intimidation. We have plenty
of both at home. Only an American can
understand the cumulative anger in his
countryman’s heart as affront is added
to affront, and the slow lapse of time
brings us neither redress nor redemption.
However sanguine and however
peace-loving we may be, we cannot well
base our hopes of future security on the
tenderness shown us in the past. If long
months of painful suspense, of hope alternating
with despondency, and pride
with shame, have wrought no other
good, they have at least revealed to us
where our danger lies. They have bared
disloyalty, and have put good citizens
on their guard.</p>

<p>Somewhere in the mind of the nation
is a saving sanity. Somewhere in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
heart of the nation is a saving grace. A
day may come when these two harmonious
qualities will find expression in the
simple words of Cardinal Newman:
“The best prudence is to have no fear.”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Americanism">Americanism</h2>
</div>


<p>Whenever we stand in need of
intricate knowledge, balanced
judgment, or delicate analysis,
it is our comfortable habit to question our
neighbours. They may be no wiser and
no better informed than we are; but a collective
opinion has its value, or at least
its satisfying qualities. For one thing,
there is so much of it. For another, it seldom
lacks variety. Two years ago the
“American Journal of Sociology” asked
two hundred and fifty “representative”
men and women “upon what ideals, policies,
programmes, or specific purposes
should Americans place most stress in the
immediate future,” and published the answers
that were returned in a Symposium
entitled, “What is Americanism?”
The candid reader, following this symposium,
received much counsel, but little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
enlightenment. There were some good
practical suggestions; but nowhere any
cohesion, nowhere any sense of solidarity,
nowhere any concern for national
honour or authority.</p>

<p>It was perhaps to be expected that
Mr. Burghardt Du Bois’s conception of
true Americanism would be the abolishment
of the colour line, and that Mr.
Eugene Debs would see salvation in the
sweeping away of “privately owned industries,
and production for individual
profit.” These answers might have been
foreseen when the questions were asked.
But it was disconcerting to find that all,
or almost all, of the “representative”
citizens represented one line of civic policy,
or civic reform, and refused to look
beyond it. The prohibitionist discerned
Americanism in prohibition, the equal
suffragist in votes for women, the biologist
in applied science, the physician in
the extirpation of microbes, the philanthropist
in playgrounds, the sociologist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
in eugenism and old-age pensions, and
the manufacturer in the revision of taxes.
It was refreshing when an author unexpectedly
demanded the extinction of inherited
capital. Authorship seldom concerns
itself with anything so inconceivably
remote.</p>

<p>The quality of miscellaneousness is
least serviceable when we leave the world
of affairs, and seek admission into the
world of ideals. There must be an interpretation
of Americanism which will express
for all of us a patriotism at once
practical and emotional, an understanding
of our place in the world, and of the
work we are best fitted to do in it, a sentiment
which we can hold—as we hold
nothing else—in common, and which
will be forever remote from personal solicitude
and resentment. Those of us whose
memories stretch back over half a century
recall too plainly a certain uneasiness
which for years pervaded American
politics and American letters, which made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
us unduly apprehensive, and, as a consequence,
unduly sensitive and arrogant.
It found expression in Mr. William Cullen
Bryant’s well-known poem, “America,”
made familiar to my generation by
school readers and manuals of elocution,
and impressed by frequent recitations
upon our memories.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“O mother of a mighty race,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Yet lovely in thy youthful grace!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The elder dames, thy haughty peers,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Admire and hate thy blooming years;</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">With words of shame</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And taunts of scorn they join thy name.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There are eight verses, and four of
them repeat Mr. Bryant’s conviction that
the nations of Europe united in envying
and insulting us. To be hated because we
were young, and strong, and good, and
beautiful, seemed, to my childish heart,
a noble fate; and when a closer acquaintance
with history dispelled this pleasant
illusion, I parted from it with regret.
France was our ally in the Revolutionary War.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
Russia was friendly in the Civil
War. England was friendly in the Spanish
War. If the repudiation of state debts
left a bad taste in the mouths of foreign
investors, they might be pardoned
for making a wry face. Most of them
were subsequently paid; but the phrase
“American revoke” dates from the period
of suspense. By the time we celebrated
our hundredth birthday with a world’s
fair, we were on very easy terms with
our neighbours. Far from taunting us
with shameful words, our “haughty
peers” showed on this memorable occasion
unanimous good temper and good
will; and “Punch’s” congratulatory
verses were among the most pleasant
birthday letters we received.</p>

<p>The expansion of national life, fed by
the great emotions of the Civil War, and
revealed to the world by the Centennial
Exhibition, found expression in education,
art, and letters. Then it was that
Americanism took a new and disconcerting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
turn. Pleased with our progress,
stunned by finding that we had poets,
and painters, and novelists, and magazines,
and a history, all of our own, we
began to say, and say very loudly, that
we had no need of the poets, and painters,
and novelists, and magazines, and histories
of other lands. Our attitude was
not unlike that of George Borrow, who,
annoyed by the potency of Italian art,
adjured Englishmen to stay at home and
contemplate the greatness of England.
England, he said, had pictures of her own.
She had her own “minstrel strain.” She
had all her sons could ask for. “England
against the world.”</p>

<p>In the same exclusive spirit, American
school boards proposed that American
school-children should begin the study
of history with the colonization of America,
ignoring the trivial episodes which
preceded this great event. Patriotic protectionists
heaped duties on foreign art,
and bade us buy American pictures. Enthusiastic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
editors confided to us that “the
world has never known such storehouses
of well-selected mental food as are furnished
by our American magazines.”
Complacent critics rejoiced that American
poets did not sing like Tennyson,
“nor like Keats, nor Shelley, nor Wordsworth”;
but that, as became a new race
of men, they “reverberated a synthesis of
all the poetic minds of the century.” Finally,
American novelists assured us that
in their hands the art of fiction had
grown so fine and rare that we could no
longer stand the “mannerisms” of Dickens,
or the “confidential attitude” of
Thackeray. We had scaled the empyrean
heights.</p>

<p>There is a brief paragraph in Mr.
Thayer’s “Life and Letters of John Hay,”
which vividly recalls this peculiar phase
of Americanism. Mr. Hay writes to Mr.
Howells in 1882: “The worst thing in our
time about American taste is the way it
treats James. I believe he would not be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
read in America at all if it were not for his
European vogue. If he lived in Cambridge,
he could write what he likes; but
because he finds London more agreeable,
he is the prey of all the patriotisms. Of
all vices, I hold patriotism the worst,
when it meddles with matters of taste.”</p>

<p>So far had American patriotism encroached
upon matters of taste, that by
1892 there was a critical embargo placed
upon foreign literature. “Every nation,”
we were told, “ought to supply its
own second-rate books,”—like domestic
sheeting and ginghams. An acquaintance
with English authors was held to
be a misdemeanour. Why quote Mr.
Matthew Arnold, when you might quote
Mr. Lowell? Why write about Becky
Sharp, when you might write about
Hester Prynne? Why laugh over Dickens,
when you might laugh over Mark
Twain? Why eat artichokes, when you
might eat corn? American school-boys,
we were told, must be guarded from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
feudalism of Scott. American speech
must be guarded from the “insularities”
of England’s English. “That failure in
good sense which comes from too warm
a self-satisfaction” (Mr. Arnold does
sometimes say a thing very well) robbed
us for years of mental poise, of adjusted
standards, of an unencumbered outlook
upon life.</p>

<p>It is strange to glance back upon a
day when we had so little to trouble us
that we could vex our souls over feudalism
and fiction; when—in the absence
of serious problems—we could raise
pronunciation or spelling into a national
issue. Americanism has done with trivialities,
patriotism with matters of taste.
Love for one’s country is not a shallow
sentiment, based upon self-esteem. It is
a profound and primitive passion. It may
lie dormant in our souls when all goes
well. It may be thwarted and frustrated
by the exigencies of party government.
It may be dissevered from pride or pleasure.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
But it is part of ourselves, wholly
beyond analysis, fed upon hope and fear,
joy and sorrow, glory and shame. If,
after the fashion of the world, we drowsed
in our day of security, we have been
rudely and permanently awakened. The
shadow of mighty events has fallen across
our path. We have witnessed a great
national crime. We have beheld the utmost
heights of heroism. And when we
asked of what concern to us were this
crime and this heroism, the answer came
unexpectedly, and with blinding force.
The sea was strewn with our dead, our
honour was undermined by conspiracies,
our factories were fired, our cargoes
dynamited. We were a neutral nation
at peace with the world. The attack
made upon our industries and upon our
good name was secret, malignant, and
pitiless. It was organized warfare, without
the courage and candour of war.</p>

<p>The unavowed enemy who strikes in
the dark is hard to reach, but he is outside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
the pale of charity. There was something
in the cold fury of Mr. Wilson’s
words, when, in his message to Congress,
he denounced the traitors “who have
poured the poison of disloyalty into the
very arteries of our national life,” which
turned that unexpansive state-paper into
a human document, and drove it straight
to the human hearts of an injured and
insulted people. Under the menace of
disloyalty, Americanism has taken new
form and substance; and our just resentment,
like the potter’s wheel, has
moulded this force into lines of strength
and resistance. We have seen all we
want to see of “frightfulness” in Europe,
all we want to see of injustice, supported
by violence. We are not prepared
to welcome any scheme of terrorization
in the interests of a foreign power, or
any interference of a foreign power with
our legitimate fields of industry. Such
schemes and such interference constitute
an inconceivable affront to the nation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
Their stern and open disavowal is the
shibboleth by which our elections may
be purged of treachery, and our well-being
confided to good citizenship.</p>

<p>Of all the countries in the world, we
and we only have any need to create
artificially the patriotism which is the
birthright of other nations. Into the
hearts of six millions of foreign-born
men—less than half of them naturalized—we
must infuse that quality of
devotion which will make them place
the good of the state above their personal
good, and the safety of the state
above their personal safety. It is like
pumping oxygen into six million pairs
of lungs for which the common air is
not sufficiently stimulating. We must
also keep a watchful eye upon these
men’s wives,—when they are so blessed,—and
concentrate our supreme energy
on uncounted millions of children, whose
first step toward patriotism is the acquirement
of a common tongue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span></p>

<p>We are trying fitfully, but in good
faith, to work this civic miracle. Americanization
Day is but one expression
of the nation-wide endeavour. When
Cleveland invited all her citizens who
had been naturalized within a twelve-month
to assemble and receive a public
welcome, to sit on a platform and be
made much of, to listen to national
songs and patriotic speeches, and to
take home, every man, a flag and a seal
of the city, she set a good example
which will be widely followed. The celebrations
at Riverside, California, and
New York City’s Pageant of the Nations
had in view the same admirable
end. Sentiment is not a substitute for
duty and discipline; but it has its uses
and its field of efficacy. Such ceremonies
perseveringly repeated for twenty years
might work a change in the immigrant
population of to-day, were we secure
from the fresh millions which threaten
us to-morrow. That the Fourth of July<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
should be often selected for these rites
is perhaps inevitable; it is a time when
patriotism assumes a vivid and popular
aspect; but Heaven forbid that we should
rechristen Independence Day, Americanization
Day! However ready we may
be to welcome our new citizens, however
confident we may be of their value
to the Republic, we are not yet prepared
to give them the place of honour hitherto
held by the signers of the Declaration
of Independence. The name which
perpetuates the memory of that deed
is a sacred name, and should be preserved
no less sacredly than the national
life which was then committed to
our keeping.</p>

<p>It is no insult to the immigrant to say
that he constitutes one of the perils of
Americanism. How can it be otherwise?
Assume that he is a law-abiding citizen,
that he knows nothing of the conspiracies
which have imperilled our safety,
that he does not propose to use his vote<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
in the interests of a foreign power, and
that the field of hyphenated politics
has no existence for him. For all these
boons we are sufficiently grateful. But
how far does he understand the responsibilities
he assumes with the franchise,
how far does he realize that he has
become part of the machinery of the
state, and how far can we depend upon
him in our hour of need? He knows, or
at least he has been told, that he may
not return home to fight for his own
country, if he seeks American citizenship.
He must resist a natural and a noble
impulse as the price of his coveted
“papers.” But will there spring in his
heart a noble, though not very natural,
impulse to fight for us if we call our sons
to arms? Can we hope that his native
intelligence, unshackled by any working
knowledge of our language, will grasp
our national policy and our national obligations;
and that—free from conscription—he
will voluntarily risk his life in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
behalf of a government for which he has
no inheritance of fidelity?</p>

<p>We have opened our doors to unrestricted
immigration, partly because capitalists
want plenty of cheap labour,
which is not a good reason; and partly
because the immigrants want to come,
which is not a sufficient reason. They
also—despite the heart-rending conditions
depicted by Miss Frances Kellor—want
to stay. Those who return to the
higher standards of Europe do not materially
affect the situation. They stay, and
either surmount their difficulties, or, succumbing
to them, fill our asylums, hospitals,
and almshouses. For many years,
foreign economists must have looked
with relief at the countless thousands of
derelicts who were supported by the
United States instead of by their own
governments. But even the satisfaction
we have thus afforded does not wholly
justify our course. Is it worth our while
to fill the air with clamour over eugenics<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
and birth-control, to build barriers around
a marriage license, and to dramatize impassioned
pleas for sterility, when the
birthrate of the Republic is nobody’s
concern? If the survival of the fittest
means as much to the commonwealth as
to the family, why should we fiddle over
pathology while the nation burns?</p>

<p>Miss Kellor is not the only kind-hearted
American who holds her countrymen
to blame for the deficiencies of
the immigrant. Her point of view is a
common one, and has some foundation
in fact. She censures us even for his dirt,
though if she had ever listened to the
vitriolic comments of the police, she
might revise her judgment on that score.
“Can’t you <i>do</i> anything?” I once asked
a disconsolate guardian of the peace, who
stood on a fine hot day contemplating
the forth-flung garbage of the Israelite.
To which he made answer: “Did ye iver
thry to clane out a sthable wid a toothpick?”
And as this had not been one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
my life’s endeavours, I offered no further
comment. But Miss Kellor touches a vital
truth when she says that Americans will
never weld a mass of heterogeneous humanity
into a nation, until they are able
to say what they want that nation to be,
and until they are prepared to follow a
policy intelligently outlined. In other
words, Americanism is not a medley of
individual theories, partial philanthropies,
and fluid sentiment. A consistent
nationalism is essential to civic life, and
we are not dispensed from achieving
consistent nationalism by the difficulties
in our way. No multiplication of difficulties
makes an impossibility. Upon what
props did the Venetians build the fairest
city of the world?</p>

<p>We cannot in this country hope for
the compelling devotion which has animated
Germany; still less for the supreme
moral and intellectual force which
is the staying power of France. Mrs.
Wharton has best described the intelligence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
with which Frenchmen translate
their ideals into doctrine. They know for
what they stand in the civilized world,
and the first “white heat of dedication”
has hardened into steel-like endurance.
To the simple emotions of men who are
defending their homes from assault have
been added the emotions of men who
are defending the world’s noblest inheritance
from degradation. “It is the reasoned
recognition of this peril which is
making the most intelligent people in
the world the most sublime.”</p>

<p>The problems of England are so closely
akin to our own problems, and her perplexities
are so closely akin to our own
perplexities, that we should regard them
with insight and with sympathy. We too
must pause in every keen emergency to
cajole, to persuade, to placate, to reconcile
conflicting interests, to humour conflicting
opinions,—termed by those who
hold them, “principles.” We too must
forever bear in mind the political party<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
which is in power, and the political party
which waits to get into power; and we
must pick our way as best we can by the
cross-lights of their abiding hostility. We
too must face and overcome the dough-like
resistance of apathy.</p>

<p>I have been told—though I refuse to
believe it on hearsay—that British labourers
have asked what difference it would
make to them whether they worked for
British or for German masters. It is quite
true that British pacifists and British radicals
have not only put this question, but
have answered it, greatly to their own
satisfaction, in American periodicals; but
American periodicals are not mouth-pieces
of the British workmen. I make
no doubt that if we were fighting for our
lives, there would be found American
pacifists and American radicals writing
in British periodicals that no great harm
would come to America if she submitted
passively to invasion; and that, whether
their country’s cause were right or wrong,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
the slaughter of her sons was a crime,
and the wealth of her capitalists was a
sufficient reason for refusing to do battle
for her liberty. The painful certainty that
we should never be free from the babbling
of treason, any more than England
is free from it now, makes Americanism
(the Americanism which means civic loyalty
founded on civic intelligence) shine
like a far-off star on a very dim horizon.</p>

<p>At present, disloyalty founded upon
ignorance meets with more attention
than it deserves. Why, after all, should
two thousand people assemble in New
York to hear Miss Helen Keller say that,
in the event of invasion, the American
workman “has nothing to lose but his
chains”? He has his manhood to lose, and
it should mean as much to him as to any
millionaire in the land. What new and
debilitating doctrine is this which holds
that personal honour is the exclusive attribute
of wealth, and that a labourer
has no more business with it than has a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
dog! The fact that Miss Keller has overcome
the heavy disabilities which nature
placed in her path, lends interest to her person,
but no weight to her opinions, which
give evidence of having been adopted
wholesale, and of having never filtered
through any reasoning process of her
own. It is always agreeable to hear her
speak about good and simple things.
When she said in Philadelphia that happiness
does not lie in pleasure, and that,
although she did not expect to be always
pleased, she did expect to be always
happy, by doing what she could to make
those about her happy, we gave our
hearty concurrence to sentiments so unexceptionable.
It was the way we ourselves
should have liked to feel, and we
knew it was our own fault that we did
not. But when in New York she adjured
workingmen never to enter the United
States Army, and informed us that all
we needed for adequate defence were
shooting-galleries “within reach of every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
family,” so that we could all learn—like
the old ladies in “Punch”—to fire a
gun, there was something profoundly
sad in words so ill-judged and so fatuous.
It cannot be a matter of no moment that,
in the hour of our danger and indecision,
thousands of people stand ready
to applaud the disloyal utterances which
should affront every honourable man or
woman who hears them.</p>

<p>The “Yale Review” quotes the remark
of a “foreigner” that Americans
are always saying, “I don’t care.” The
phrase is popular, and sounds disheartening;
but if we spare ourselves concern
over trivial things (if, for example, we
were not excited or inflamed by Captain
von Papen’s calling us “idiotic Yankees”),
it does not follow that big issues
leave us unmoved. If they did, if they
ever should, the word Americanism
might as well be obliterated from the
language. The consistent nationalism
for which it stands admits of no indifference.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
It is true that the possible peril of
New York—as defenceless as a soft-shell
crab, and as succulent—is not an
ever-present care to San Francisco. It is
true that San Francisco’s deep anxiety
over Japanese immigration and land-ownership
was lightly treated by New
York. And it is true that Denver, sitting
in the safety zone, looks down from her
lofty heights without any pressing solicitude
about either of her sister cities. But
just as the San Francisco earthquake
wrung the heart of New York, so the
first gun fired at New York would arm
the citizens of San Francisco. Only it
might then be too late.</p>

<p>The Christmas cartoon of Uncle Sam
holding a package marked “Peace and
Prosperity,” and saying with a broad
smile, “Just what I wanted!” was complacent
rather than comprehensive. We
want peace and we want prosperity,
but they are not all we want; partly because
their permanency depends upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
certain props which seem to many of us
a bit unsteady, and partly because we do
not, any more than other men, live by
bread alone. The things of the spirit are
for us, even as for heroic and suffering
France, of vital worth and import. If we
could say with certainty, “All is gained
but honour,” there are still some of us
who would feel our blessings incomplete;
but, as it chances, the contempt meted
out to us has taken the palpable form of
encroachment upon our common rights.
Until we can protect our industries from
assault and our citizens from butchery,
until we can couple disavowal of past
injuries with real assurance of safety in
the future, peace limps, and prosperity
is shadowed. With every fresh shock
we have received, with every fresh sorrow
we have endured, there has come to
us more and more clearly the vision of a
noble nationalism, purged of “comfort-mongering,”
and of perverted sentiment.</p>

<p>Cynical newspaper writers have begun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
to say that the best way to make
Americans forget one injury is to inflict
on them another. This is hardly a half-truth.
The sinking of the Ancona did
not obliterate from our minds the names
of the Falaba, the Gulflight, the Frye,
the Hesperian, the Arabic, and the Lusitania.
Neither has the sinking of the
Persia buried the Ancona in oblivion.
And it is not simple humanity which has
burned these names into the tablets of
our memories. The loss of American
lives through the savage torpedoing of
liners and merchant ships might be doubled
and trebled any summer day by the
sinking of an excursion steamer, and we
should soon forget. A country which reports
eight thousand murders in a single
year is not wont to be deeply stirred by
the perils which beset our munition-workers.
But when Americans have
gone to their deaths through the violence
of another government, or in the interests
of another government, then the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
wrong done them is elevated to the importance
of a national calamity, and redress
becomes a national obligation.
Because we do not wearily reiterate this
patent truth does not mean that we have
forgotten it. If words could save, if words
could heal, we should have no fear, nor
shame, nor sorrow. Nothing is less worth
while than to go on prattling about a
consistent foreign policy. The corner-stone
of civilization is man’s dependence
for protection on the state which he has
reared for his own safety and support.</p>

<p>The concern of Americans for America
(I use the word to symbolize the
United States) must be the deep and
loyal sentiment which brooks no injustice
and no insult. We have need of many
things, but first and foremost of fidelity.
It is a matter of pride and pleasure that
some of our foreign-born citizens should
excel in art and letters; that, under
our tutelage, they should learn to design
posters, model statuary, write poems, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
make speeches. These things have their
admitted place and value. The encouragement
which is given them, the opportunities
which are made for them, the
praise which is lavished upon them, are
proofs of our good-will, and of our genuine
delight in fostering ability. But the
real significance of the “Americanization”
movement, the summoning of conferences,
the promoting of exhibitions,
the bestowing of prizes, is the need we all
feel of unification, the hope we all cherish
that, through the influence of congenial
work, immigrants and the children of
immigrants will become one in spirit with
the native born. We could make shift
to do without the posters and the symbolic
statuary; we could read fewer
poems and listen to fewer speeches; but
we cannot possibly do without the loyalty
which we have a right to demand,
and which is needful to the safety of the
Republic.</p>

<p>For the main thing to be borne in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
mind is that Americanization does not
mean only an increase of opportunity
for the alien, an effort toward his permanent
well-being. It means also service
and sacrifice on his part. This is what
citizenship entails, although voters and
those who clamour for the vote seldom
take into account such an inexorable
truth. The process of assimilation must
go deeper than the polling booth and the
trade union can carry it. Democracy forever
teases us with the contrast between
its ideals and its realities, between its
heroic possibilities and its sorry achievements.
But it is our appointed road, and
the stones over which we perpetually
stumble deny us the drowsy perils of content.
When we read Dr. Eliot’s noble
words in praise of free government and
equal opportunities, we know that his
amazing buoyancy does not imply ignorance
of primaries, of party methods, and
of graft. With these things he has been
familiar all his life; but the creaking machinery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
of democracy has never dimmed
his faith in its holiness. Remediable disorders,
however grievous and deep-seated,
afford us the comfort of hope, and the
privilege of unending exertion.</p>

<p>To no one ignorant of history can the
right of citizenship assume any real significance.
In our country the ballot is so
carelessly guarded, so shamefully misused,
that it has become to some men a
subject of derision; to many, an unconsidered
trifle; to all, or almost all, an expression
of personal opinion, which, at
its best, reflects a popular newspaper,
and, at its worst, stands for nothing less
hurtful than stupidity. A recent contributor
to the “Unpopular Review” reminds
us soberly that, as the democratic state
cannot rise above the level of its voters,
and as nationality means for us merely
the will of the people, it might not be
amiss to guard the franchise with reasonable
solicitude, and to ask something
more than unlimited ignorance, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
absence of a criminal record, as its price.
If every man—alien or native-born—who
casts his ballot could be made to
know and to feel that “all the political
forces of his country were mainly occupied
for a hundred years in making
that act possible,” and that the United
States is, and has always been, the nation
of those “who willed to be Americans,”
citizenship might become for us what it
was to Rome, what it is to France,—the
exponent of honour, the symbol of self-sacrifice.</p>

<p>A knowledge of history might also
prove serviceable in enabling us to recognize
our place and our responsibility
among the nations of the world. No
remoteness (geographical remoteness
counts for little in the twentieth century)
can sever our interests from the interests
of Europe, or lift from our shoulders the
burden of helping to sustain the collective
rights of mankind. We know now
that the menace of frightfulness has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
overshadowed us. We know that, however
cautiously we picked our steps, we
could not, and did not, escape molestation.
But even if we had saved our own
skin, if we had suffered no destruction
of property, and if none of our dead lay
under the water, the freedom of Europe,
the future of democracy, and the rights
of man would be to us matters of concern.</p>

<p>It is true, moreover, that friendship
and alliance with those European states
whose aspirations and ideals respond to
our own aspirations and ideals, are as
consistent with Americanism as are
friendship and alliance with the states of
South America, which we are now engaged
in loving. It is not from Bolivia,
or Chile, or Venezuela, or the Argentine
that we have drawn our best traditions,
our law, language, literature, and
art. We extend to these “sister Republics”
the arms of commercial affection;
but they have no magic words like Magna<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
Charta and <i>le Tiers État</i> to stir our souls
an inch beyond self-profit. When we
count up our assets, we must reckon
heavily on the respect of those nations
which we most respect, and whose good-will
in the past is a guarantee of good-will
in the future. It is worth our while,
even from the standpoint of Americanism,
to prove our fellowship with humanity,
our care for other interests than
our own. The civilization of the world is
the business of all who live in the world.
We cannot see it crashing down, as it
crashed in the sinking of the Lusitania
and the Ancona, and content ourselves
with asking how many Americans were
drowned. Noble standards, and noble
sympathies, and noble sorrows have
their driving power, their practical utility.
They have counted heavily in the
destinies of nations. Carthage had commerce.
Rome had ideals.</p>
